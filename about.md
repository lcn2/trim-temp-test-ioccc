# About the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC)

The IOCCC stands for the International Obfuscated C Code Contest.
The IOCCC is a C programming contest.

The goals of the IOCCC are:

* To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program within the rules.
* To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
* To stress C compilers with unusual code.
* To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
* To provide a safe forum for poor C code. :-)
* To have fun with C!

See the
FAQ on "[start of the IOCCC](faq.html#ioccc_start)"
and the
FAQ on "[history of the IOCCC website](faq.html#website_history)"
for more information the background of the IOCCC.

See the
FAQ on "[entering the IOCCC](faq.html#submit)"
for information on how to enter and submit to the IOCCC.

If you are still confused, consider the nature of
the [IOCCC Rules](next/rules.html) and of the [IOCCC
Guidelines](next/guidelines.html).  You will see a dose of the technical,
mixed with "nerd humor" (or humour if you prefer 🤓).

If after all that you are still confused, sorry (tm Canada 🇨😉).
Consider this: While the IOCCC often attempts to be presentable,
it is under no obligation to be wholly understandable.  One might
say that to truly understand the IOCCC is problematic. And if
someone did manage to fully understand the IOCCC, then perhaps
this **modified** quote from the [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
may apply:

> "There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers
exactly what the IOCCC is for and why it is here, it will
instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre
and inexplicable.
>
> There is another theory which states that this has
[already happened](faq.html#great_fork_merge)." 😜

Share and enjoy! ☺️
