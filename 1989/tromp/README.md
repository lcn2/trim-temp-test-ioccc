## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make all
```


## To use:

```<!---sh-->
    ./tromp [drops_per_sec  [cmd_string]]
```


## Try:

```<!---sh-->
    ./tromp 5

    ./tromp 10 "hkl jq"
```

The second command, `./tromp 10 "hkl jq"`, will set up the keys kind of like
vim:

- h	    - left (left)
- k	    - rotate (up)
- l	    - right (right)
- j	    - drop (down)
- space	    - pause (space)
- q	    - quit (:q)

NOTE: after the game ends a file called `HI` will be in the directory with the
high scores (up to 20 runs saved) so one can see who has the highest score. The
file might look like:

```
    330 by luser
    136 by loser
    100 by winner
```

... or so, where in this case the [luser is the winner, the loser is in second
place and the winner is the
loser](https://web.archive.org/web/20181023221954/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2002-07-31-0207310310-story.html) :-)


## Alternate code:

The author provided an alternate version of the code with some improvements. See
the judges' additional remarks in the author's remarks, for more details.


### Alternate build:

```<!---sh-->
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `tromp.alt` as you would `tromp` above.

NOTE: testing more than one user updating the high score file, one of the
benefits of the alt version, has not been done.

The original unmodified alternate code, which will no longer work right if it
even compiles, is provided later in the author's remarks.


## Judges' remarks:

This is a character terminal version of the `TETRIS` game.
It runs on a VT100 compatible terminal or emulator.  It is
best used at 4800 baud or more.

By default, `drops_per_sec`, the number of times a tetrimino
will drop in a second, is 2.  The default `cmd_string` is
`jkl pq`.  The first 6 characters of `cmd_string` relate
to the following 6 game commands:

- j		- left
- k		- rotate
- l		- right
- space		- drop
- p		- pause
- q		- quit

Specifying `cmd_string` allows one to redefine the commands.
The pause command pauses the game, clears the screen and
prints the current score.  To resume, type the pause
character again, which by default is `p`.

As was stated last year, we are likely to be more strict about
portability in the future.  [ We mean it this time :-) ]


## Author's remarks:

This program plays the familiar game of `TETRIS` with the
following features:

* outputs vt100-like escape-sequences for cursor
  positioning and normal/reverse video in curses
  like fashion (minimal output for screen updates)

* continuously increasing speed (except in pause)

* start speed selectable by giving `n` as first argument,
  where `n` is the number of drops per second (default=2).

* controls also selectable by giving as the second argument
  a string of 6 characters.  By default they are `jkl pq`.

* screen is blanked during the pause and the score is shown

* maintains a high-score table

Giving a full path name for the table will result in a
system-wide high-score allowing a competition between users.

### Additional remarks from the judges:

The author provided us with the following notes and new version of
the program:

Here is a somewhat improved version of my tetris entry.  All the
changes are in the `popen()` at the end.  Formerly a move was done
to the HI score file which is not permitted for other users. Now
other users can change the `HI` score file.  The extra option `-m` is
passed to sort, so that it knows that its input files are already
sorted.  The `-o` output option of sort is used instead of a
temporary file.

You may also want to consider giving just the raw option to `stty`
at the start and `-raw` at the end. This further reduces the size of
the program, but has the possible disadvantage that the program
can only by stopped by 'q' or by the `kill -9' command.

```

NOTE: the alternate version was fixed for modern systems in 2023.
