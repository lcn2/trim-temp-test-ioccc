## To build:

```sh
make all
```

To get this to compile with a modern CPP, we had to replace `#D` with `#define`.


## To use:

Run the program this way:

```sh
./ovdluhe < textfile
```

The program stops when it reaches the end of the template buffer
by chance or is killed.


### Try:

```sh
./try.sh ; sleep 2 ; ./try.sh
```


## Alternate code:

The author suggested that one varies the definition of `P` from 2 through 10. As
it's a `#define` it's easy to set up.


### Alternate build:

```sh
make P=9 clobber alt
```

You do not have to define `P` but if you do you can replace the value with
whatever you wish, as long as it's a positive `int` (or evaluates to a positive
`int` like the default `(A<<AP)` does). Too high a value will likely cause the
program to fail and a negative value will cause a compilation error.


### Alternate use:

```sh
./ovdluhe.alt
```

### Alternate try:

```sh
./try.alt.sh

P=5 ./try.alt.sh
```

NOTE: if you specify too high a value for `P` the program might fail. If you
specify a value < 0 it will fail to compile.


## Judges' remarks:

Run this program using your favorite text file as input.  Files
such as mailboxes, man pages and usenet articles are especially
recommended.  You will get different output each time you run it.


## Author's remarks:

This program implements an "Eddington ape" - it generates
random text from a supplied template.  The template text file
is read through stdin.  The larger the template, the better the
result.  A maximum of `2**12` chars are used. From the template,
the program calculates the statistics of chars that immediately
follow a given string (correlator string) of a certain length
(currently 4 - can be varied by changing the definition for P
accordingly).  A character is randomly chosen, weighted by its
probability to occur after the correlator string.  That
character is printed to stdout and placed at the end of the
correlator string, whose first character is discarded.
Meaningful words are therefore usually preserved, the effect on
sentences can be dramatically random.

You might want to vary the definition of P between 2 and 10 and
observe the result.
