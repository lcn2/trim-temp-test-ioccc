## Judges' remarks:

Do you know what this program does?  If you do, look again, there is more here
than meets the PI.


## Author's remarks:

Passes lint, but not with the strictest options, for it contains some
"null-statements", as well two identifiers which are, if compilers only take 6
characters, the same.  It also uses `write(2)`, so not totally system
independent.

You are very much invited to pass this program through a C-beautifier (first
strip newlines and tabs, if your `cb` can't do that).
