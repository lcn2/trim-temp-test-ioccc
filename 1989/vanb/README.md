## Judges' remarks:

This program computes all proper subsets of the set of
arguments passed to it.  Each subset is printed with one
element on each line, followed by a line of ten dashes.


## Author's remarks:

The program has the following charming and possibly
non-portable features:

* It has no local or global variables, only the command-line parameters.

* It calls `main()` recursively.

* It alters the command-line parameters.

* It uses the fact that if the high bit is set in a character variable, the
value is negative.
