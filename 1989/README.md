# Sixth International Obfuscated C Code Contest

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

Instructions for use: Run `make` to compile entries (it is possible that on
System V or non-Unix systems the Makefile needs to be changed).

The Makefile for [Best self modifying program](fubar/index.html) always uses
the most portable version because there is no loss of functionality in
using it.  In the case of the [Best game](tromp/index.html) entry, however, some
functionality is lost in the portable version and so its Makefile uses
the original program.

This year, the [Best of Show](jar.2/index.html) was given to the most useful program.

The [Strangest abuse of the rules](jar.1/index.html) award was given this year
to stress the fact that starting in 1990, compiling entries must result a
regular executable file.

[Rules](rules.txt) and [results](../years.html#1989) were posted to
_comp.lang.c_, _comp.sources.unix_ and
_alt.sources_.  They have been made available on a wide number of USENET
archive sites such as _uunet_.  The 1989 winning entries will be published in the
[Micro/Systems
Journal](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?microsystemsjournal).
