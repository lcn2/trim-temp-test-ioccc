# 1989 marked the "The Sixth International Obfuscated C Code Contest"

Look at the README.md file for the given winning entry for information
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

Instructions for use: Run `make` to compile entries (it is possible that on
System V or non-Unix systems the Makefile needs to be changed).

This year, the Grand Prize was given to the most useful program.

The ["Strangest abuse of the rules"](jar.1/README.md) award was given this year
to stress the fact that starting in 1990, compiling entries must result an
executable regular file.

The Makefile always uses the portable version of the ["Best
self modifying program"](fubar/README.md) because there is no loss of functionality in
using it.  In the case of the ["Best game"](tromp/README) winner, however, some
functionality is lost in the portable version and so the Makefile uses
the original program. System V users may need to change the Makefile
to use the s5 version. See the hint files or the Makefile for details.

[Rules](rules.txt) and results were posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix, and
alt.sources.  They have been made available on a wide number of USENET
archive sites such as uunet.  The 1989 winners will be published in the
[Micro/Systems
Journal](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?microsystemsjournal).
