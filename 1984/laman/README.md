## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
```


### Bugs and (Mis)features:

The current status of this entry is:

> **STATUS: INABIAF - please DO NOT fix**

For more detailed information see [1984/laman in bugs.html](../../bugs.html#1984_laman).



## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./laman <positive number>
```


## Try:

The program accepts ONE POSITIVE number.  Seeing is believing, so try things
like:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```

This code should run you in circles.


## Judges' remarks:

Some new compilers (in 1984) dislike lines 6 and 10 of the source, so we changed
them from:

``` <!---c-->
        ;++f)a[         b<<5|c]         =d++,b+         =e;for(         f=0;f<O
        <<5|c]^         a[b<<5          |c]^=a[         (k-(b+1         ))<<5|c]
```

to:

``` <!---c-->
        ;++f)a[         b<<5|c]         =d++,b+=        e;for(          f=0;f<O
        <<5|c]^=        a[b<<5          |c]^=a[         (k-(b+1         ))<<5|c]
```

I hope you have a C beautifier!
