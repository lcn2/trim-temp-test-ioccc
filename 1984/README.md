In 1984, the first contest was held.  The name of the contest was simply
``Obfuscated C Code Contest''.

Look at the README.md file for the given winner for information on how to
compile the winner and how to run the winning program.  Look at the winning
source and try to figure how it does what it does!  You may then wish to look at
the Author's remarks for even more details.

Restrictions against machine dependent code were not in the [rules](rules.txt)
in 1984. The source file size restriction was only 512 bytes.  Rules and results
were posted to net.lang.c and net.unix-wizards.
