## Judges' remarks:

The author was too embarrassed that they could write such trash, so I
promised to protect their identity.  I will say that the author of this
program has a well known connection with the C programming language.

This program is a unique variation on the age old "hello, world!" program.  What
reads like a read may be written like a write!

In 2005 someone by the name of Thomas Scovell got a tattoo of this entry. See
his [web
page](https://web.archive.org/web/20070120220721/https://thomasscovell.com/tattoo.php)
on the Internet Wayback Machine for more information on the tattoo. Along with
the code, this is what it looks like:

<img src="1984-anonymous-tattoo.jpg"
 alt="image of a tattoo of the 1984 anonymous C code"
 width=600 height=401>


## Author's remarks:

### On remaining anonymous:

Some years after this entry was published we asked the author if they still
wished to remain anonymous and they said:

> Yes, I want to keep my anonymity.  But you can tell them that I am well known
for my connection to the C language.


### On the famous tattoo (see above):

The author, when told about this tattoo, said:

> I feel honored that my entry will be the first IOCCC winning entry to become a
tattoo. It is the first entry to become a tattoo isn't it?

Landon Curt Noll, the one who told the author about the tattoo, wrote back:

> Yes, to our knowledge it is.


### Regrets:

Landon Curt Noll wrote that the author regrets not making the program a
one-liner and not moving the `int i` into an arg of `main()` (so that the line
would have started with `main()`). On the other hand the author likes the "two
line look" and the way `hell o` was split. :-) And they like the fact that it
ends in a smily face: `;}`.
