# Second place award 

Dave Decot  

## To build:

```sh
make all
```

## To run:

```sh
./decot
```

### Alternate code:

To try the original code that requires `-traditional-cpp`:

```sh
make alt
./decot.alt
```


## Judges' remarks:

This program prints out a string of garbage.

The judges also offer this one comment: understand remarks!

### Historical remarks:

Some new (in 1984) compilers disliked line 15 of the original source, so we changed it
from:

```c
for(signal=0;*k * x * __FILE__ *i;) do {
```

to:

```c
for(signal=0;*k *x * __FILE__ *i;) do {
```


To see what we mean look at the source file in the
[archive/archive-1984.tar.bz2](/archive-1984.tar.bz2) tarball or
[decot.alt.c](decot.alt.c).
