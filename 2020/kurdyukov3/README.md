## Judges' remarks:

It is interesting how well smeonoe can raed txet wtih lots of tyops in it.
How well can you raed porg.c, C prgoarm that is in the shpae of an SD card (or
is it a pnuch crad)?

BTW: this funny reading of English (which also works with several other
languages) is called
[typoglycemia](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/)
(the article however is incorrect in stating that if the letters were more
jumbled or if other words were formed one could not read it: we know of some who
can in fact do exactly that). Also, to be clear, there was no such study stated
in [input.txt](input.txt) but as you'll likely see you should be able to do
exactly what it says nonetheless.


## Author's remarks:

### Letter Mixer

Compile and try this:

```sh
cat input.txt | ./prog
```

The program can work with letters that are not represented in English, as long
as these letters are encoded in the higher part of the single-byte character set
(use `iconv` to convert from UTF-8 and back).
