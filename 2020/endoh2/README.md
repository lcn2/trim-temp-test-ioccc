## Judges' remarks:

Clever use of the C99 complex data type. The spoiler.zip file contains clues
as to how some winning authors create / edit programs into ASCII shapes.

With the source from the spoiler.zip file could you make the code render for a
larger terminal window?  How about adding more glyphs?

## Author's remarks:

No!  Try not.  Do, or do not.  There is no try.

```sh
cc -std=c99 prog.c
./a.out
./a.out hello.txt
./a.out yoda.txt
./a.out bear.txt
```

See spoiler.zip for the source code.
