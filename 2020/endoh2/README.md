## Judges' remarks:

Clever use of the C99 complex data type. The [spoiler](spoiler/) directory
contains clues as to how some winning authors create / edit programs into ASCII
shapes.

With the source from the [spoiler](spoiler/) directory could you make the code
render for a larger terminal window?  How about adding more glyphs?


## Author's remarks:

No!  Try not.  Do, or do not.  There is no try.

``` <!---sh-->
    cc -std=c99 prog.c
    ./a.out
    ./a.out hello.txt
    ./a.out yoda.txt
    ./a.out bear.txt
```
