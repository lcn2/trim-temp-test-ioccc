# I, Cody Boone Ferguson, want to dedicate this entry in part to the millions of
# poor souls that were lost during the tragedy that is the Second World War.
# There are so many people who are unknown, unloved, unclaimed and even
# unidentified. And who knows what they might have gone on to do if their lives
# weren't - like it is with all other wars - needlessly taken from them? When
# one considers it was all because the most powerful man in the world at the
# time felt he should rule all others it makes it somehow even more tragic:
# there wasn't even a good reason for the war (is there ever?).
# 
# If one were to write the name of every person who died in the conflict in a
# book, it would take so many pages that the book would be so heavy, so long, so
# expensive to print and it wouldn't bring anyone back to life nor would it erase
# the suffering. Nothing will. It's horrible.
# 
# There really are no words that can truly describe the tragedy but I wish to
# with my Enigma simulator honour each and every soul who was lost, or suffered,
# or suffered the loss of friends or loved ones, as well as the world itself, in
# and from one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind.
