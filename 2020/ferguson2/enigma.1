.SH NAME
enigma \- A German Enigma simulator for IOCCC 2020
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBenigma [-]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBenigma\fP is a German Enigma simulator written for IOCCC 2020.
It only supports the Heer (army) and Luftwaffe (air force) machines.
Its default settings are as follows:
\fBWheel order (Walzenlage)\fP \fII, II, III\fP; \fBRing settings (Ringstellung)\fP \fIABC\fP; \fBInitial positions (Grundstellung)\fP \fIBBC\fP; \fBReflector (Umkehrwalze, UKW)\fP \fIB\fP; and the \fBplugboard (Steckerbrett)\fP is empty (no pairings).
.PP
There are no options per se; if not passed a \fB\-\fP (in the first argument) then it will use the default settings, waiting for input (unless input is piped to it e.g. from the recode program, echo or redirecting a file as stdin).
Otherwise it will prompt you for the settings and then wait for input to encipher/decipher.
.SH FILES
\fIprog.c\fP
.RS
Source file to the simulator.
.RE
\fIrecode.c\fP
.RS
Source code to the configuration tool (not required but recommended).
.RE
\fIrecode.md\fP
.RS
Markdown file with examples on how to use the recode program (along with the Enigma program).
.RE
\fIREADME.md\fP
.RS
More information on the Enigma simulator IOCCC entry.
.RE
\fIchocolate\-cake.md\fP
\fIchocolate\-cake.html\fP
.RS
A file with a recipe of a delicious Double-layered Chocolate Fudge Cake that has been enciphered with one of 16 Enigma settings given in \fIrecode.md\fP which should give enough information on how to make use of the two programs in order to unlock this recipe.
I recommend the html version for formatting.

I don't think you need help here! :)
.RE
\fIrecode.1\fP
.RS
The recode.c man page.

.SH BUGS
.PP
Rudimentary parser allows for easily piping into the simulator settings (and file to encipher/decipher) but which also can be a bit confusing, unintuitive and does not handle too much input that well.
.PP
There is one thing in particular I was unsure of when writing the simulator as far as how it is supposed to work: I believe I have it but there might be one issue. See \fIREADME.md\fP for more information.
.PP
It was written by a human being.
.PP
Not a bug as some might want to believe, maybe: figuring out how the recode.c program works won't help you figure out how this works.
.PP
The critical flaw in the Enigma machine that I referred to in the \fIREADME.md\fP obviously has to be in the program.
.PP
For more please see \fIREADME.md\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Please see the \fIrecode.md\fP and \fIREADME.md\fP files for examples and other information.
