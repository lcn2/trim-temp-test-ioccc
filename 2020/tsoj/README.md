## To build:

```sh
make
```


There is an alternate version which has controls that will make much more sense
to those familiar with vi. See [Alternate code](#alternate-code) below.


## To use:

```sh
./prog
```


## Try:

```sh
# Make your terminal as large as possible, possibly reduce your font size
# then...
./prog
```


## Alternate code:

This version has the difference of moving forwards, left, backwards and right,
where instead of `w`, `a`, `s` and `d`, you can use `k`, `h`, `j` and `l`.


### Alternate build:

```sh
make alt
```


### Alternate use:

```sh
# Make your terminal as large as possible, possibly reduce your font size
# then...
./prog.alt
```

..and maybe curse less than you might otherwise, but still probably curse (see
below) :-)


## Judges' remarks:

This game does not use curses, but you may end up cursing.

The code is made more difficult to read using an innovative, right justified,
reverse indentation style.


## Author's remarks:

### Controls

- Movement: `w` (forwards), `a` (left), `s` (backwards), `d` (right)
- Fire: space
- Quit: `q`
- Pause: `p`, then use any other key to resume


```
   /\
  //\\
 /    \
/______\
  /\/\
```


### Compile and run

#### Linux
```
cc -std=c99 -O3 prog.c -o prog
./prog
```

#### Windows

The only way I found to make it work is to use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).
When using the MSYS2 shell you can install gcc via pacman.

```
cc -std=c99 -O3 prog.c -o prog
./prog.exe
```

### High score

Score will be shown in the top left corner.
My best was **156**. If you beat that I'll send you the image of a very
expensive chocolate.
