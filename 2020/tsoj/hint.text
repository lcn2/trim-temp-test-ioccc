The code for this entry can be found in prog.c

## Judges' comments:
### To use:

    make
    ./prog


### Try:

    # Make your terminal as large as possible, possibly reduce your font size
    # then...
    ./prog

### Selected Judges Remarks:

This game does not use curses, but you may end up cursing.

The code is made more difficult to read using an innovative, right justified,
reverse indentation style.

## Author's comments:
#### Controls
- Movement:  
`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`
- Fire:  
`space`
- Quit:  
`q`
- Pause:  
`p`, then use any other key to resume

```
   /\
  //\\
 /    \
/______\
  /\/\
```
#### Compile and run
###### Linux
```
cc -std=c99 -O3 prog.c -o prog
./prog
```

###### Windows
The only way I found to make it work is to use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org). When using the MSYS2 shell you can install gcc via pacman.
```
cc -std=c99 -O3 prog.c -o prog
./prog.exe
```

Score will be shown in the top left corner.  
My best was **156**. If you beat that I'll send you the image of a very expensive chocolate.
#### Features
