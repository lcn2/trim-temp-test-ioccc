.SH NAME
snake \- Feature\-rich curses implementation of the classic 'Snake' game with many gameplay modes and options for IOCCC 2020
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnake\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsnake\fP has two cheat modes (passable walls/self[cannibalism]), a drawing/practising mode, \fIcan play by itself\fP (\fBand win!\fP), is coloured (included \fIsnake-colours.sh\fP and \fIplay.sh\fP scripts compile in player\-selected colours) and there are many other play modes (many more can be devised with the imagination and the environmental variables; see \fbENVIRONMENT\fP and the file \fIgameplay.markdown\fP for many examples) and options.
You can pause and there's even a built\-in test unit for some features!
Some of the configurable features are:
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP The speed of the snake (how many milliseconds to \fBWAIT\fP for input before moving; \fIdefault 231 milliseconds\fP and you can move faster by pressing the direction key quicker or or even holding it down).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP If the bug (to eat) will move (\fBEVADE\fP) after user\-specified number of snake moves (\fIdefault 300, 0 disables\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP If the snake can go through \fBWALLS\fP (coming out at the opposite wall) (\fIdefault 1, yes\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP If the snake can go through itself (\fBCANNIBAL\fP) (\fIdefault 0, no\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP The initial \fBSIZE\fP of the snake (\fIdefault 5\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP The size the snake must become in order to win the game (\fBMAXSIZE\fP, \fIdefault 997\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP How much to \fBGROW\fP each time a bug is eaten (\fIdefault 5\fP, can be negative).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP How many moves (\fBSHED\fP, \fIdefault 0, disabled\fP) before 'stretching' (grow) (\fBSHEDS\fP, \fIdefault 5\fP; can be negative).
This is how snakes grow in the wild so is a misnomer here because snakes don't grow in the manner that the original Snake game was designed.
.RS
\fB\- Exception\fP: If the bug is eaten the counter isn't incremented.
.RE
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP A drawing mode (\fBWAIT < 0\fP makes \fBtimeout()\fP set blocking read).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP Computer plays the game (\fBWAIT=0\fP)
\fB(EPILEPSY/STIMULATION OVERLOAD TRIGGER WARNING\fP included in the relevant section of the \fIgameplay.markdown\fP; this goes for low \fBEVADE\fP values too).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP Grow\-Shrink (Positive and Negative Winning) mode (see \fIgameplay.markdown\fP for more details).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP The dimensions of the game (this is actually a terminal thing but I document how to do this and its potential pitfalls) (\fBLINES\fP, \fBCOLUMNS\fP).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\-\fP Different colours and characters for the bug, snake head, snake and walls:
.RS
\fB\-\fP Bug is \fB*\fP (white).
.RE
.RS
\fB\-\fP Head is an arrow facing the direction the snake is facing (\fB<\fP, \fB^\fP, \fB>\fP, \fBv\fP) (red).
.RE
.RS
\fB\-\fP Body is \fBo\fP (green).
.RE
.RS
\fB\-\fP Walls are \fB#\fP (cyan).
.RE
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options are specified via the environmental variables.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environmental variables modify the behaviour of the game:
.PP
\fBGROW\fP
.RS
How much to grow each time a bug is eaten.
Negative growth is a different gameplay mode.
\fIDefault 5\fP.
.RE
\fBSIZE\fP
.RS
The initial size of the snake.
\fIDefault 5\fP.
.RE
\fBMAXSIZE\fP
.RS
The max snake size (the size the snake must become to win).
\fIDefault 997\fP.
Limits are always imposed depending on the size of the terminal.
Negative number sets to max size based on terminal size.
.RE
\fBWAIT\fP
.RS
The number of milliseconds to wait for input (how fast the snake moves).
\fIDefault 231\fP.
\fI0\fP has no delay: the computer will play by itself (though you can still change directions).
\fI< 0\fP is drawing mode (makes \fIgetch()\fP block).
.RE
\fBEVADE\fP
.RS
The number of movements before the bug tries to move to a new place (evading the snake).
\fIDefault 300\fP (0 disables).
.RE
\fBWALLS\fP
.RS
Whether the snake can go through walls.
\fIDefault 1\fP (yes).
.RE
\fBCANNIBAL\fP
.RS
Whether the snake can go through itself.
\fIDefault 0\fP (no).
.RE
\fBSHED\fP
.RS
How many moves before the snake 'moults' (shedding of skin to make room for growth).
Again this isn't technically accurate in Snake.
\fIDefault 0\fP (disabled).
.RE
\fBSHEDS\fP
.RS
The amount to grow by each time the snake sheds its skin.
\fIDefault 5\fP.
.RE
.PP
The following two modify the terminal dimensions (this is not part of the game but the terminal/curses itself):
.PP
\fBLINES\fP
.RS
The number of rows.
Default is the maximum size of the current terminal size (\fBecho $LINES\fP will show the current value).
Please note that this is not the number of playable rows but the entire game itself.
.RE
\fBCOLUMNS\fP
.RS
The number of columns.
Default is the maximum size of the current terminal size (\fBecho $COLUMNS\fP will show the current value).
Please note that this is not be the number of playable columns but the entire game itself.
.RE
.SH FILES
The markdown files have html counterparts; for some of these the html version is probably easier to read and make use of.

.RE
\fIremarks.markdown\fP
.RS
Describes what the entry (game) is, what it looks like, how to play etc.
Includes a variety of other information as well as NAQs (never asked questions that I believe could actually be asked so perhaps better would be infrequently asked questions, IAQs).
.RE
\fIgameplay.markdown\fP
.RS
Includes information on how to play, demonstrates some of the features and describes many gameplay modes.
.RE
\fItroubleshooting.markdown\fP
.RS
Information to help work out any possible problems as well as show how to configure and restore terminal dimensions for the game.
.RE
\fIterminals.markdown\fP
.RS
A troubleshooting guide focusing more on terminals.
.RE
\fICOMPILING\fP
.RS
Information on Portability, C standards as well as (for the IOCCC judges) both Justifications for certain things and lints.
.RE
\fIHACKING\fP
.RS
Documentation on how to modify the input keys, colours, wall, bug and snake chars (to print), the status/score line and various other things.
Includes feature ideas as well as how one might implement them.
.RE
\fIspoilers.markdown\fP
.RS
Technical details that give more away about how the program works (\fIHACKING\fP also does a bit of this).
.RE
\fIMakefile\fP
.RS
To build the terminal capabilities test utility and the Snake game itself.
.RE
\fIsnake-colours\fP
.RS
Helper script to compile the game with player selected colours.
.RE
\fIbugs.markdown\fP
.RS
List of bugs and things that might appear to be bugs that aren't, were once bugs etc.
.RE
\fIchocolate\-cake.markdown\fP
.RS
The judges love chocolate and who can blame them? This is something of a speciality of my mum's but it's a delicious cake that even my late stepmum (who only liked white chocolate) loved! Double\-layer chocolate fudge cake.
.RE
\fItermcaps.c\fP
.RS
Source file to test terminal support for the used capabilities the Snake game uses.
.RE
\fIsnake.1\fP
.RS
See this file to see the manual i.e. this file.
Don't get lost in the snake pit!
.RE
\fIcannibalism.log\fP
.RS
A screen dump of what cannibalism can look like right before winning.
.RE
\fIcrazy.log\fP
.RS
A screen dump of the positive/push - negative/shrink mode.
.RE
\fIplay.sh\fP
.RS
Script that prompts if you want to reconfigure colours and then gives you a menu that runs some preconfigured game modes.
This script essentially combines \fIsnake-colours\fP with some preset modes that you can select from a menu.
.RE
\fIprog.2.c\fP, \fIprog.3.c\fP, \fIprog.3-j.c\fP, \fIprog.alt.c\fP
.RS
Other versions I submitted. \fIprog.2.c\fP is the second version; \fIprog.3.c\fP and \fIprog.3-j.c\fP were the third where the \fI-j\fP version was a minor change to the J define.
\fIprog.alt.c\fP is the file that has support for colour customisation of the bug (this would have broken rule 2a/b so I could not submit it as my primary version).
It also clears the screen before playing to try and maintain terminal sanity should you pass the LINES environmental variable to the program.
.RE
.RE
.SH BUGS
.RS
\fB\-\fP The screen keeps showing bugs!
.RE
.RS
\fB-\fP There's no boss screen.
.RE
.RS
\fB\-\fP It was written by a human being.
.RE
.RS
\fB\-\fP Technically walls, snakeskin and the snake itself would \fBnot\fP be an obstacle in real life.
The shed snakeskin is not an obstacle but walls can be and so can the snake itself.
Also snakes grow by moulting (technical term for shedding) so when the snake leaves its snakeskin behind it really ought to grow but instead it shrinks; this means negative shedding ought to have the snake grow and positive shedding have the snake - what?
It's a misnomer: it took fewer bytes and the negative shedding is a positive consequence of unsigned arithmetic.
.RE
.PP
On a more serious note see the \fBbugs.markdown\fP file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Test your terminal capabilities and get other various data (based on dimensions of terminal, growth size, size and max size as specified i.e. you can pass in the variables \fBLINES\fP, \fBCOLUMNS\fP, \fBMAXSIZE\fP, \fBGROW\fP and \fBSIZE\fp):
.nf
.RS
\fB
 make test\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is imperfect!
.PP
Allow the snake to go through itself but not through walls, make the snake move at 400ms and start out at size 7:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 CANNIBAL=1 WALLS=0 WAIT=400 SIZE=7 ./snake\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Let the snake go through itself and the walls, make the bug stay put until it's eaten, have the snake grow by 7 every 150 snake movements, start out at size 4 and grow by 7 every time a bug is eaten:
.PP
.RS
.nf
 \fBCANNIBAL=1 WALLS=1 EVADE=0 SHED=150 SHEDS=7 SIZE=4 GROW=7 ./snake\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Allow the game to play by itself, winning, after starting the game (move in a direction) (\fBDON'T TRY IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY!\fP):
.nf
.RS
\fB
 CANNIBAL=1 WAIT=0 MAXSIZE=30 SIZE=0 EVADE=1\fP ./snake
.fi
.RE
.PP
That allows the snake to go through itself, makes the max size fairly small (to make it easier to win and quicker), sets the size to 0 (start with only the head) and make the bug move every time the snake moves (and does not catch it). Once you move the snake a direction it moves so quickly that because the bug is evading the snake inevitably runs into the bug thus growing in size etc.
.PP
Run script that prompts for the colours to be used, compiles and then runs the game (with environmental variables passed in):
.nf
.RS
 \fBCANNIBAL=1 SIZE=15 MAXSIZE=45 WALLS=0 ./snake-colours\fI
.fi
.RE
.PP
That will compile the game to be the colours you select and then enable cannibalism, set the starting size to 15, max size to 45 and walls are made impassable.
.PP
For more gameplay information and modes check \fIgameplay.markdown\fP; and for an interactive script that prompts for some of those modes see the \fIplay.sh\fP script.
