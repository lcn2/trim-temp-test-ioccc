# Terminals

Terminals are very easy to mess up and for that reason they deserve their own
file. I discuss terminal capabilities, dimensions (setting and how to restore
sanity if it causes any problems) as well as colours (limitations etc.).

# <a name="termcaps" href="#toc">Capabilities support testing program</a>

Although it should be playable without the features I use (except that cursor
movement is required) I have provided a source file that can test your terminal
for the capabilities I use in the entry.

It also tries to determine the minimum number of columns to play without the
status line overflowing - even with the dynamic length. Try:

	    $ make test

This compiles the program and runs it; you should see something like:

	    terminal supports cursor movement
	    terminal supports making cursor invisible
	    terminal supports bold
	    terminal supports colours

	    terminal rows  42 (39  playable)
	    terminal cols 157 (155 playable)

	    snake size:   997 (max size: 6006)
		  bugs:   199 (max size: 1201)

	    at least 34 columns recommended for snake size 997   (is 157)
	    at least 37 columns recommended for snake size 6006  (is 157)

	    No problems detected.

If I pass in any of the variables **GROW**, **MAXSIZE**, **SIZE** and/or
**LINES** or **COLUMNS** it bases its calculations on those variables. For
example:

	    $ MAXSIZE=-1 GROW=1  make test
	    terminal supports cursor movement
	    terminal supports making cursor invisible
	    terminal supports bold
	    terminal supports colours

	    terminal rows  42 (39  playable)
	    terminal cols 157 (155 playable)

	    snake size:  6006 (max size: 6006)
		  bugs:  6001 (max size: 6001)

	    at least 37 columns recommended for snake size 6006  (is 157)
	    at least 37 columns recommended for snake size 6006  (is 157)

	    No problems detected.


As you can see it tells you the max size (the 'capsized' snake) as well as
the requested max size (if the requested size is bigger than the capsize then it
will be set to that value instead) of the snake. The capped size is like in the
Snake game itself but the suggested minimum number of columns is based on a
number of variables.

If I were to do the above but set columns to less < 35 then there would be a
problem. But why if the utility recommends at least 37? This is because the
max size of the snake also depends on the terminal size. This utility is not
perfect: I don't consider shedding; I set growth to 5 if it's 0 (since it would
be indeterminate how many bugs are possible before 'winning' since there would
be no 'winning'); and there are probably other things too.

As for capabilities: besides cursor movement the others are just nice to have.
From my tests keeping the cursor visible doesn't ruin gameplay but it is less
distracting if nothing else to have it invisible (in fact due to the sequence of
function calls the cursor would mostly appear to be not in the game field itself -
from memory at least).

Maybe there are other capabilities I should check for that I'm unaware of but
this should give you an idea.

If there are any problems it will say how many (fatal and otherwise). The fatal
problems are if curses fails to initialise or if movement of cursor cannot be
done (both seem odd).

Both scripts run this utility and prompt if there are any problems;
you can continue either way.

# <a name="dimensions" href="#toc">Setting the game dimensions</a>

There are a number of ways to do this and only one will keep the terminal sane
all the time but that's by running it under a terminal emulator that you can
resize the window with first. But what if you want exacts?


## <a name="linescolumns" href="#toc">The LINES and COLUMNS environmental variables</a>

To specify the lines/columns of curses program per instance use the `LINES` and
`COLUMNS` environmental variables.

For demonstration consider the following:

	    $ echo $LINES $COLUMNS
	    42 157

Note: I subtract 1 from the max y/x and the max coords in the game output
include the walls and score line but these values are for the terminal itself.

Say you want 55 columns:

	    $ COLUMNS=55 ./prog

This will force curses to detect the max columns (X) of your terminal (for the
game dimensions) - to be 55; it might look like this instead:

	    X:27/54 Y:20/41 S:5/997 B:0

But problems can arise with messing with dimensions: in my tests this held only
to lines.

## <a name="insanity" href="#toc">Terminal insanity</a>

Terminal sanity can be compromised and it can cause all sorts of output
problems; it might not appear right away but it will show its ugly head
eventually if you use it. For example pager output might be screwy, echo might
be turned off, output of commands might overwrite the input of those commands,
etc. For the game you might not see the final score.


### <a name="restore" href="#toc">Restoring the terminal</a>

In my tests there is one thing that at least allows you to see the final score
and that is by running `clear` before running the program. That's what the
prog.alt version does. You might run it as one of:

	    LINES=20 ./prog.alt
	    LINES=20 ./snake.alt


Even if the final score is visible though the terminal may very well still be
messed up. There are numerous things you might try but probably the easiest is
to run the game again without modifying the dimensions (and then just quit) or
even just the `reset` command.


The Linux man page says:

    You might have to run the `reset` tool like:

		   <LF>reset<LF>

	       (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal
	       to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state.


If you don't have the reset utility you can try:

		echo -e \\033c

Otherwise try `clear; stty sane` (that will turn on echo also) or if all else
fails log out and back in.

For more information on this subject generally see the [Linux keyboard and
console HOWTO][] (specifically [Linux keyboard and console HOWTO section 4][]).
Yes this works under macOS (at least it did for me).

### <a name="abuse" href="#toc">Terminal size abuse</a>

So players 1, 2 and 3 are content with not meddling with the terminal sizes
outside what's actually possible with their screen. But then player 4 comes
along and thinks he/she will be clever and mess with the dimensions a bit. Let's
say they have a 13" monitor and they think it'd be funny to see how 997 lines
would work; they might try something like:

		LINES=997 ./prog

What then? Well expect trouble; curses will not know any better and the max
number of lines will be 997. If they were to do:

		COLUMNS=997 ./prog

Then they will see a different effect. Again the same reason: the player trying
to be funny.

The game will try and be funny in return and you can expect it to not function
properly. Because that's what funny means in this context.


# <a name="termlimitations" href="#toc">Terminal limitations</a>

It'd be nice if curses could detect hitting more than one arrow key at the
same time so that diagonal directions would be possible but unfortunately it's
not (`cat -v` confirms this). Even if I were to define four extra keys what
would they be? And what about the head character? The HACKING file has
information on this.

I also limit the terminal size to 10 lines/columns but most likely it would
require the cheat modes to win and in any event allowing certain low values
causes problems e.g. **LINES=6 COLUMNS=6** and **LINES=3 COLUMNS=3** caused some
nasty issues.


# <a name="colours" href="#toc">Terminal colours</a>

N.B.: If all you're after is wanting to change the colours see the script
[snake-colours.sh][] instead. The rest of this file was mostly notes for the
judges; here I discuss the background, foreground as well as limitations (in
particular runtime limitations).

## <a name="background" href="#toc">Curses background</a>

The documentation I have seen says that the background will always be black and
from a quick test this holds even with a terminal that has a white background.
There is a way to force the background to remain white though that's by way of
monochrome (so no colours); I discuss that and another related terminal specific
in the troubleshooting guide (there's another way but it would take me over the
iocccsize; I talk about it in the HACKING file).

## <a name="monochrome" href="#toc">Monochrome terminals</a>


According to my tests for monochrome terminals the screen has the white and
black background; if terminal is configured to be black background white
foreground that is the order it is too. You can try that like:

		TERM=linux-m ./prog

But I do not specifically check if the terminal has colours. Is there a curses
implementation that has a problem here? Below I explain what to comment out
should you need colours to be disabled but I personally have not run into any
problems even with monochrome terminals. Later I say what to do to remove colour
support in the source code itself.

## <a name="colourlimitations" href="#toc">Colour limitations</a>

According to X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (pg. 57):

	With init_pair() and pair_content(), the value of pair must be in a range
	from 0 to and including COLOR_PAIRS-1. (There may be an
	implementation-specific upper limit on the valid value of pair, but any such
	limit is at least 63.) Valid values for f and b are the range from 0 to and
	including COLORS-1.

The manpage for `init_pair()` says this:

	       These limits apply to color values and color pairs.  Values outside these limits are not legal, and may result in a runtime error:

	       [...]

		    COLOR_PAIRS corresponds to the terminal database's max_pairs capability, (see terminfo(5)).

Based on the two as well as the fact that monochrome terminals (I've tried under
both Linux and macOS) seem to work fine I believe I am fine here too. And to
confirm this I wrote the following code with the output below:

	    #include <curses.h>

	    int main()
	    {
		initscr();
		start_color();
		printw("COLORS: %d\nCOLOR_PAIRS: %d\n", COLORS, COLOR_PAIRS);
		getch();
		endwin();
	    }

	    TERM=linux-m ./colour_pairs
	    COLORS: 0
	    COLOR_PAIRS: 0

Without specifying the TERM I get:

	    COLORS: 256
	    COLOR_PAIRS: 32767

In the case that colour is supported the standard states that there will be more
possible colour pairs than I have used so that's not a problem either. Perhaps
even it would only be a runtime error if the colours are supported and the
number is out of the range? To try and figure this out I did another test:

	    int main()
	    {
		initscr();
		start_color();

		init_pair(COLOR_PAIRS+1, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_GREEN);
		bkgd(COLOR_PAIR(COLOR_PAIRS+1));
		init_pair(1, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLACK);
		attron(COLOR_PAIR(1));
		printw("COLORS: %d\nCOLOR_PAIRS: %d\n", COLORS, COLOR_PAIRS);

		getch();
		endwin();
	    }

Running it like

	    TERM=linux-m ./colour_pairs

I got the output as if colours weren't used: 0 and 0. With coloured terminals
however it was not visible. If I however comment out the call to `bkgd()` I get
instead:

	    COLORS: 256
	    COLOR_PAIRS: 32767

Which leads me to believe that if you try using a value outside the range it
won't work for a colour-capable terminal but it doesn't matter for monochrome
terminals one way or another. And since I don't go beyond the ranges (as I cited
earlier) there shouldn't be any problem here.

## <a name="disablecolour" href="#toc">Disabling colour</a>

Nevertheless if it is a problem and you don't want to use a monochrome terminal
(or can't):

First comment out the code that has `start_color();` and then add `return;` to the
top of the `C()` function (the rest of the code won't be reached). If necessary
you can also comment out the `init_pair()` calls.

Perhaps you only need to add the `return;` to `C()`. My guess is that's the case
but I do not know for certain.
