<h1 id="double-layered-chocolate-fudge-cake">Double-layered Chocolate Fudge Cake</h1>
<p>Here’s a delicious double-layered chocolate fudge cake that is
something of my mum’s speciality. It’s complicated and I should warn that nobody
has seemed to get it down as well as she has but it’s well worth the effort if
you love chocolate and have the time and patience.</p>
<p>My late stepmum who only liked white ‘chocolate’ loved this cake! The picture
below is after it’s been iced. The image <a href="ioccc-cake.jpg">ioccc-cake.jpg</a> was a
feeble attempt at drawing <code>IOCCC</code> into the cake before icing, a different time.
The picture below was taken for my birthday (14 February) in 2022 as it’s the
best one I have:</p>
<figure>
<img src="cake.jpg" alt="picture of the Double-layered chocolate fudge cake" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">picture of the Double-layered chocolate fudge cake</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are two sets of ingredients and instructions; the cake and the icing. In
addition there are some <strong>VERY IMPORTANT NOTES</strong> to pay attention to; some will
be repeated because they’re <strong>VITALLY IMPORTANT</strong> for the quality of the cake.
That cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Below I have included the ingredients separately but I include them within the
instructions as well and in bold. Also in bold are some of the special notes.</p>
<p>Finally note that depending on where you are in the world this might not work in
the warmer months of the year and for the icing in particular.</p>
<p>Above all, <strong>ENJOY</strong>, and <strong>I’D LOVE TO SEE PHOTOS AND HEAR WHAT YOU THINK</strong> at
<a href="https://fosstodon.org/@xexyl"><span class="citation" data-cites="xexyl">@xexyl</span><span class="citation" data-cites="fosstodon.org">@fosstodon.org</span></a>. Questions also welcome
there of course. Please make sure to mention me so I get a push notification as
I don’t check it very often. Thanks and again enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="measurements">Measurements</h2>
<p>This was originally taken from an American magazine for women so the
measurements are in the US standards. A nice resource (that has much more than
just cooking) is <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/cooking.htm" class="uri">http://www.onlineconversion.com/cooking.htm</a>. This will
particularly matter for cups, teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces.</p>
<h2 id="bakers-chocolate">Baker’s chocolate</h2>
<p>Baker’s chocolate is a brand name and the product in question is unsweetened
chocolate bars used for baking. According to a <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/chocolate-faqs/">chocolates FAQ</a> it might be
called different things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bitter chocolate contains no sugar and is often called ‘unsweetened’ or
‘baking’ chocolate. In some countries it’s called 100% cacao since it’s composed
only of ground up cocoa beans, and nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FAQ suggests that you might have to look for a baking supply shop but I
cannot offer any specific advice other than it’s unsweetened chocolate bars for
baking. The FAQ talks about what looks like substitutes but I have no idea what
that would turn out as; I somehow suspect it wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p>Either way <strong>PLEASE STILL PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE NOTES on the chocolate IN THE RECIPE and
RECIPE NOTES BECAUSE THEY’RE <em>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="special-notes-for-the-cake">Special notes for the cake</h2>
<p><strong>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>USE <em>MARGARINE</em>! DO <em>NOT</em> USE BUTTER!</strong> Butter does not work well. If you
think it will come out better by using butter you’re very mistaken; it will
come out badly! People have come back saying it didn’t come out well and
they are asked if they used butter or margarine. They had used butter
because they ‘know better’ but they were very wrong and it is why the cake
was ruined.</p></li>
<li><p>Over the years they changed the size of the unsweetened chocolate squares;
they used to be one ounce each; now they are 1/4 ounce each square so be sure to
remember that <strong>THE AMOUNT IS BY OUNCE <em>NOT SQUARES</em> AS LISTED</strong>. See the
measurements link if there’s any doubt.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay careful attention to the <strong>COOK FOR ONLY THE INDICATED TIME</strong> part. Note
that if your oven cooks a bit hotter you might have to adjust the timing a
bit. This is likely the case if the cake comes out a little bit dry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>REMOVE THE CAKE FROM THE PANS <em>2 MINUTES AFTER REMOVING FROM OVEN</em></strong> and
then allow to <strong>FULLY COOL <em>ON RACKS!</em></strong> The important point is to <strong>MAKE SURE
THAT THEY <em>DON’T OVERCOOK</em></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When the recipe was first written they sold powdered sugar in a box; now
it’s confectionery sugar in a bag. My mum experimented with the amount and
found that 4 cups seems about right.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USE <em>WHOLE MILK!</em></strong> Don’t try skim milk or whatever per cent of fat milk you
have.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>ONLY <em>PURE</em> VANILLA EXTRACT!</strong> <strong>DO <em>NOT USE IMITATION VANILLA!</em></strong> Not
following this rule will lead to a worse outcome.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cake-ingredients">Cake Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 oz unsweetened (Baker’s) chocolate</li>
<li>2 and 1/4 cups flour</li>
<li>2 tbsp baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 and 1/4 cups packed brown sugar</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 tsp <strong>PURE VANILLA EXTRACT (<em>NOT IMITATION VANILLA!</em>)</strong></li>
<li>1/2 cup <strong>MARGARINE (<em>NOT BUTTER!</em>)</strong></li>
<li>1 cup (boiling) water</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cake-preparation">Cake Preparation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lightly grease <strong>TWO 9 x 1.5 INCH ROUND PANS</strong>; lightly dust with flour.</p></li>
<li><p>Preheat oven to <strong>350 F / 176.67 C</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cake-directions">Cake Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Melt <strong>3 OZ UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE</strong> in double boiler or small bowl over
<strong>hot (<em>BUT NOT BOILING</em>) water</strong>; let cool whilst proceeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Sift <strong>2 and 1/4 CUPS FLOUR</strong>, <strong>2 TSP BAKING SODA</strong>, and <strong>1/2 TSP SALT</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Beat <strong>1 STICK MARGARINE (<em>NOT BUTTER!</em>)</strong> in large bowl <em>until soft</em>. Again
<strong>MARGARINE, <em>NOT BUTTER!</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Add <strong>2 and 1/4 CUPS PACKED BROWN SUGAR</strong> and <strong>3 EGGS</strong>. Beat until light and
fluffy.</p></li>
<li><p>Beat in <strong>1 1/2 TSP <em>PURE</em> VANILLA EXTRACT (<em>NOT IMITATION VANILLA!</em>)</strong> and
<strong><em>COOLED</em> MELTED CHOCOLATE</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in dry ingredients alternately with <strong>1 CUP SOUR CREAM</strong>; always beat
until smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in <strong>1 CUP <em>BOILING</em> WATER</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour into prepared pans.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake for <strong>ONLY 35 MINUTES</strong> (<strong>NO LONGER!</strong>) at <strong>350 F / 176.67 C</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you take the cake out put the cake pans on a cooling rack for **_ONLY
TWO MINUTES AND THEN <em>IMMEDIATELY TURN CAKES OUT ON TO RACK</em><strong>. Let </strong>COOL
<em>COMPLETELY!</em>**</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="icing-ingredients">Icing Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 oz unsweetened chocolate (Baker’s chocolate)</li>
<li>1/2 cup <strong>MARGARINE (<em>NOT BUTTER!</em>)</strong></li>
<li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
<li>2 tsp <strong><em>PURE</em> VANILLA EXTRACT (<em>NOT IMITATION VANILLA!</em>)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need a bigger pan or bowl that can have ice water that the icing
bowl can sit in.</p>
<h2 id="special-notes-for-the-icing">Special notes for the icing</h2>
<p><strong>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>MAKE SURE</strong> that the melted chocolate and <strong>MARGARINE (<em>NOT BUTTER!</em>)</strong>
do not get solid.</p></li>
<li><p>For step #4 put <strong>8 to 10 ICE CUBES</strong> in a pan or big bowl (that’s big
enough that another bowl can fit in it). <strong>ADD AN INCH OF WATER</strong> and <strong>SET
THE BOWL WITH THE ICING IN THE PAN OR BOWL</strong> of ice water. <strong>DO NOT LET THE
ICING GET WET!</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>DO NOT LET ICING GET TOO THICK.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>USE <em>WHOLE MILK!</em></strong> Don’t try skim milk or whatever per cent of fat milk you
have.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>ONLY PURE VANILLA EXTRACT</strong>! <strong>DO NOT USE IMITATION VANILLA!</strong> Not
following this rule will lead to a worse outcome. As I recall the icing was
quite a bit worse (but still chocolaty at least) the times we had imitation
vanilla (simply because we couldn’t get pure vanilla at the time we needed
it). Just don’t do it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="icing-directions">Icing Directions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Combine <strong>4 OZ UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE</strong> and <strong>1/2 CUP <em>MARGARINE (NOT
BUTTER!)</em></strong> in pan. Melt and remove from heat. <strong>DO NOT LET IT GET SOLID!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Combine <strong>3 1/4 CUPS POWDERED SUGAR</strong>, <strong>1/2 CUPS WHOLE MILK</strong> and <strong>2 TSP
</strong><em>PURE</em> VANILLA EXTRACT (<em>NOT IMITATION VANILLA!</em>)** into a bowl. <strong>STIR
UNTIL SMOOTH</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add chocolate mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Set bowl in pan/bowl of ice and water. Beat with spoon/mixer until it’s
thick BUT not too thick. <strong>Make <em>SURE</em> ICING DOES <em>NOT</em> GET WET!</strong> The idea is to
<strong>MAKE THE BOWL IT’S IN COLD <em>BUT TO NOT LET THE ICING GET WET!</em></strong></p></li>
