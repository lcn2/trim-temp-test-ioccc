<h1>Double-layered Chocolate Fudge Cake</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a delicious double-layered chocolate fudge cake that is
something of my mum&rsquo;s speciality. It&rsquo;s complicated and I should warn that nobody
has seemed to get it down as well as she has but it&rsquo;s well worth the effort if
you love chocolate. My late stepmum who only liked white chocolate loved this
cake!</p>

<p><img src='cake.jpg' alt='picture of the double-layered chocolate fudge cake'></p>

<p>There are two sets of ingredients and instructions; the cake and the icing. In
addition there are some notes to pay attention to; some will be repeated because
they&rsquo;re really important for the quality of the cake.</p>

<p>Below I have included the ingredients separately but I include them within the
instructions as well and in bold. Also in bold are some of the special notes.</p>

<p>Finally note that depending on where you are in the world this might not work in
the warmer months of the year for the icing in particular. Oh and here&rsquo;s an
amusing fact about the <a href="http://www.gomc.com/firstpage/200103068.pdf">IOCCC and chocolate</a>. Did I say &lsquo;the IOCCC&rsquo;? I actually
meant <strong>&lsquo;an IOCCC&rsquo;</strong>: it stands also for <strong>&lsquo;International Office of Cocoa, Chocolate
and Sugar Confectionery&rsquo;</strong>. Perfect.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/ilyakurdyukov">fellow IOCCC winner Ilya Kurdyukov</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ilyakurdyukov">GitHub</a>) as well as the
<a href="ioccc-cake.jpg">IOCCC cake source image</a> of the picture in the tweet (which he painted over
my photo of the cake with GIMP).</p>

<h2>Measurements</h2>

<p>This was originally from an American cookery book so the measurements are in the
US standards. A nice resource (that has much more than just cooking) is
<a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/cooking.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/cooking.htm</a>. This will particularly matter
for cups, teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces.</p>

<p>For example a US cup is not the same as Canadian cup and a metric cup differs
too. There&rsquo;s also a difference for teaspoons and tablespoons: there are metric,
UK and US teaspoons and tablespoons. There&rsquo;s both a UK and US ounce also.</p>

<h2>Baker&rsquo;s chocolate</h2>

<p>Baker&rsquo;s chocolate is a brand name and the product in question is unsweetened
chocolate bars used for baking. According to a <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/chocolate-faqs/">chocolates FAQ</a> it might be
called different things:</p>

<pre><code>Bitter chocolate contains no sugar and is often called 'unsweetened' or
'baking' chocolate. In some countries it's called 100% cacao since it's
composed only of ground up cocoa beans, and nothing else.
</code></pre>

<p>The FAQ suggests that you might have to look for a baking supply shop but I
cannot offer any specific advice other than it&rsquo;s unsweetened chocolate bars for
baking. The FAQ talks about what looks like substitutes but I have no idea what
that would turn out as; I somehow suspect it wouldn&rsquo;t be good.</p>

<p>Either way please <strong>still pay attention to the notes on the chocolate in the recipe and
recipe notes because they&rsquo;re really important!</strong></p>

<h2>Special notes for the cake</h2>

<p><strong>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>USE MARGARINE</strong>. Butter does not work well.</p></li>
<li><p>Over the years they changed the size of the unsweetened chocolate squares;
they used to be one ounce each now they are &frac14; ounce each square so be sure to
note the amount is by ounce not squares as listed. See the measurements link
if there&rsquo;s any doubt.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay careful attention to <strong>cook for only the indicated time</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remove the cake from the pans 2 minutes after removing from oven</strong>. Then allow
to fully cool on racks. The important point is that they don&rsquo;t overcook.</p></li>
<li><p>When the recipe was first written they sold powdered sugar in a box; now
it&rsquo;s confectioners sugar in a bag. My mum experimented with the amount and
found that 4 cups seems about right.</p></li>
<li><p>She uses <strong>whole milk</strong> for this recipe; she doesn&rsquo;t know if it really matters
but given that she and I both prefer skim milk except for here and in
chocolate milk I would recommend whole milk for this recipe too. In any case
it turns out great!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Cake Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>3 oz unsweetened (Baker&rsquo;s) chocolate</li>
<li>2 and &frac14; cups flour</li>
<li>2 tbsp baking soda</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>
<li>2 and &frac14; cups packed brown sugar</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>1 and &frac12; tsp vanilla</li>
<li>&frac12; cups margarine</li>
<li>1 cup (boiling) water</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
</ul>


<h2>Cake Preparation</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Lightly grease two 9 x 1.5 inch round pans; lightly dust with flour.</p></li>
<li><p>Preheat oven to 350 F (176.67 C).</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Cake Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Melt <strong>3 oz unsweetened chocolate</strong> in double boiler or small bowl over
<strong>hot (<em>but not boiling</em>) water</strong>; let cool whilst proceeding.</p></li>

<li><p>Beat <strong>1 stick margarine</strong> in large bowl <em>until soft</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add <strong>2 &frac14; cups packed brown sugar</strong> and <strong>3 eggs</strong>. Beat until light and
fluffy.</p></li>
<li><p>Beat in <strong>1 &frac12; tsp vanilla</strong> and <strong>cooled melted chocolate</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in dry ingredients alternately with <strong>1 cup sour cream</strong>; always beat
until smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>Stir in <strong>1 cup boiling water</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour into prepared pans.</p></li>
<li><p>Bake for <strong>ONLY 35 minutes</strong> (NO LONGER) at 350 F (176.67 C).</p></li>
<li><p>When you take the cake out put the cake pans on a cooling rack for <strong>TWO
MINUTES ONLY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TURN CAKES OUT ON TO RACK</strong>. Let cool
completely.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Icing Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>4 oz unsweetened chocolate (Baker&rsquo;s chocolate)</li>
<li>&frac12; cup margarine</li>
<li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
<li>&frac12; cup whole milk</li>
<li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
</ul>


<p>You will also need a bigger pan or bowl that can have ice water that the icing
bowl can sit in.</p>

<h2>Special notes for the icing</h2>

<p><strong>PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make sure that the melted chocolate and margarine does not get solid.</p></li>
<li><p>For step #4 put <strong>8 to 10 ice cubes</strong> in a pan or big bowl (that&rsquo;s big
enough that another bowl can fit in it). Add an inch of water and then set
the bowl with the icing in the pan or bowl of ice water. <strong>Do not let the
icing get wet!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do not let icing get too thick.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>whole milk.</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Icing Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Combine <strong>4 oz unsweetened chocolate</strong> and <strong>&frac12; cup margarine</strong> in pan.
Melt and remove from heat. <strong>DO NOT LET IT GET SOLID.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Combine <strong>3 &frac14; cups powdered sugar</strong>, <strong>&frac12; cups whole milk</strong> and <strong>2 tsp
vanilla</strong> into a bowl. <strong>Stir until smooth</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add chocolate mixture.</p></li>
<li><p>Set bowl in pan/bowl of ice and water. Beat with spoon/mixer until it&rsquo;s
thick BUT not too thick. Make sure icing doesn&rsquo;t get wet! The idea is to
<strong>MAKE THE BOWL IT&rsquo;S IN COLD <em>but not let the icing get wet</em></strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
