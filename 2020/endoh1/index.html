<h3>Selected Judges Remarks:</h3>

<p>When playing Minesweeper, a misclick might ruin a game, so why not leave the routine to the computer?
This program automatically uncovers mines according to several rules, and leaves guessing (and applying
the most straightforward of the rules &ndash; just for fun, perhaps?) to the user.</p>

<p>Try creating your own input files according to the author&rsquo;s remarks. Did you encounter any problems?</p>

<p>The submission was in violation of the &ldquo;2053&rdquo; size rule by one character, likely a late typo. It was easy to fix.</p>

<h3>Semi-automatic Minesweeper</h3>

<p>Minesweeper is a game to sweep mines, as you know.  The task consists of two parts:</p>

<p>A) choose a random cell based on your sixth sense
B) identify a non-mine cell based on logical inference</p>

<p>However, (B) is error-prone, and a waste of time.  You must use a computer to do such a boring task!</p>

<p>This program is a semi-automatic minesweeper which does Part (B) automatically.
All you have to do is (A).  You can test if you are lucky or not.</p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>It uses ncurses:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -o prog prog.c -lncurses
$ ./prog
</code></pre>

<p>You will see a terminal-wide field of a minesweeper.  Probe a cell by mouse click.
If a cell turns out to have a mine (or not), the program determines whether its neighbors have a mine or not, and automatically probes (or flags) the cell.</p>

<li><code>Q</code>: quit</li>
</ul>


<h4>Internal</h4>

<p>The program uses four types of local inference:</p>

<h4>Rule 1</h4>

<p>If the number of a cell is equal to the count of the flagged neighbors, all the unprobed neighbors are probed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>
    ? ? ?      . . .
    ? 3 ?  =&gt;  . 3 .
    ! ! !      ! ! !
</code></p>

<p>Note that <code>?</code> is a unprobed cell (it is unknown whether the cell has a mine or not); <code>!</code> is a flagged cell (it is already known that the cell has a mine); and <code>.</code> is a probed cell (it is already known that the cell has no mine).</p>

<h4>Rule 2</h4>

<p>If the number of a cell is equal to the count of the unprobed or flagged neighbors, all the unprobed neighbors are flagged,</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>
    . ? ?      . ! !
    . 4 ?  =&gt;  . 4 !
    . 2 !      . 2 !
</code></p>

<h4>Rule 3</h4>

<p>Consider two number cells A and B.  If A is equal to the difference of B and the count of B&rsquo;s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not A&rsquo;s neighbors, all A&rsquo;s unprobed neighbors that are not B&rsquo;s neighbors are probed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>
    ? ? ?        . . .
    ? 1 ? ?  =&gt;  . 1 ? ?
    ? ? 4 .      . ? 4 .
      ? . !        ? . !
</code></p>

<p>A and B are probed cells whose numbers are, respectively, 1 and 4.  The count of B&rsquo;s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not A&rsquo;s neighbors is three (one <code>!</code> and two <code>?</code>s).  Since A (1) == B (4) - the count (3), the left and top unprobed cells are probed.</p>

<h4>Rule 4</h4>

<p>Consider two number cells A and B.  If B is equal to the difference of A and the count of A&rsquo;s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not B&rsquo;s neighbors, all A&rsquo;s unprobed neighbors that are not B&rsquo;s neighbors are flagged.</p>

<p><code>
    ? ? ? ?      ! ? ? ?
    ? 3 1 2  =&gt;  ! 3 1 2
    2 2 . .      2 2 . .
</code></p>

<p>A and B are probed cells whose numbers are, respectively, 3 and 1.  The count of A&rsquo;s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not B&rsquo;s neighbors is two (left <code>?</code>s).  Since B (1) == A (3) - the count (2), the left unprobed cells are flagged.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Interestingly, these complex rules can be integrated to one simple rule.  Analyze the code.</p>

<h4>One more thing</h4>

<p>You can also play with a prepared map.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./prog ioccc.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The format of the text is:</p>

<pre><code>width height number-of-mines priorities-of-each-cell...
</code></pre>

<p>There are mines in a cell whose &ldquo;priorities-of-each-cell&rdquo; is less than &ldquo;number-of-mines&rdquo;.
(But the mine in the first-clicked cell is removed.)</p>

<h4>Bug fixes and Credits</h4>

<p>The judges pointed out a bug of the original version that I submitted (prog.orig.c).  Because this program does not provide a feature to flag unprobed cells manually, we can do nothing if the number of unprobed cells are equal to the number of mines remaining; unwinnable.txt is an example for such a case.
Thus, I implemented an additional rule to flag all unprobed cells in such a case into the final version (prog.c).</p>

<p>Ilya Kurdyukov also pointed out a warning &ldquo;ignoring return value of &lsquo;fscanf&rsquo;&rdquo; only when &ldquo;-O3&rdquo; is used.  So I changed the code a little to pretend to use the return value of fscanf.</p>

<p>Don Yang (omoikane) contributed another example map &ldquo;megumin.txt&rdquo; which is the Explosion Arch-Wizard.</p>
