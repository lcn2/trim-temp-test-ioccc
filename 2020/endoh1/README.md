``` <!---sh-->
    make
```

There is an alternate version provided by the author. See [Alternate
code](#alternate-code) below.


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    # IMPORTANT for macOS: run under Terminal.app

    ./prog
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    # IMPORTANT for macOS: run under Terminal.app

    # Try resizing the terminal window before the first click.

## Alternate code:

An alternate version of this entry, [prog.alt.c](%%REPO_URL%%/2020/endoh1/prog.alt.c), is provided.  This
alternate code lacks the additional rule to flag all unprobed cells.  See the
Author's remarks for more details.


### Alternate build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `prog.alt` as you would `prog` above.


## Judges' remarks:

When playing
[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_&#x28;video_game&#x29;), a
misclick might ruin a game, so why not leave the routine to the computer?  This
program automatically uncovers mines according to several rules, and leaves
guessing (and applying the most straightforward of the rules -- just for fun,
perhaps?) to the user.

Try creating your own input files according to the author's remarks. Did you
encounter any problems?

The submission was in violation of the "2053" size rule by one character, likely
a late typo. It was easy to fix.


### For macOS:

We observe that this entry may not work under macOS using iTerm2.
Users on macOS might want to run this entry under the macOS Terminal,
which is located in `/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.


## Author's remarks:

### Semi-automatic Minesweeper:

Minesweeper is a game to sweep mines, as you know.  The task consists of two parts:

0. Choose a random cell based on your sixth sense.
1. Identify a non-mine cell based on logical inference.

However, (1) is error-prone, and a waste of time.  You must use a computer to do
such a boring task!

This program is a semi-automatic minesweeper which does part (1) automatically.
All you have to do is (0).  You can test if you are lucky or not.


### How to use:

It uses ncurses:

``` <!---sh-->
    gcc -o prog prog.c -lncurses
    ./prog
```

You will see a terminal-wide field of a minesweeper.  Probe a cell by mouse
click.

If a cell turns out to have a mine (or not), the program determines whether its
neighbors have a mine or not, and automatically probes (or flags) the cell.


### Keyboard commands:

* `r`: new game (You can also click the smiley face at the top line.).
* `q`: quit.

Input is case-sensitive.


### Internals:

The program uses four types of local inference:


#### Rule 1:

If the number of a cell is equal to the count of the flagged neighbors, all the
unprobed neighbors are probed.

Example:

```
    ? ? ?      . . .
    ? 3 ?  =>  . 3 .
    ! ! !      ! ! !
```

Note that `?` is an unprobed cell (it is unknown whether the cell has a mine or
not); `!` is a flagged cell (it is already known that the cell has a mine); and
`.` is a probed cell (it is already known that the cell has no mine).


#### Rule 2:

If the number of a cell is equal to the count of the unprobed or flagged
neighbors, all the unprobed neighbors are flagged.

Example:

```
    . ? ?      . ! !
    . 4 ?  =>  . 4 !
    . 2 !      . 2 !
```

#### Rule 3:

Consider two number cells `A` and `B`. If `A` is equal to the difference of `B`
and the count of `B`'s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not `A`'s
neighbors, all `A`'s unprobed neighbors that are not `B`'s neighbors are probed.

Example:

```
    ? ? ?        . . .
    ? 1 ? ?  =>  . 1 ? ?
    ? ? 4 .      . ? 4 .
      ? . !        ? . !
```

`A` and `B` are probed cells whose numbers are, respectively, 1 and 4.  The
count of `B`'s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not `A`'s neighbors is
three (one `!` and two `?`s).  Since `A == B - count` (`1 == 4 - 3`), the left
and top unprobed cells are probed.


#### Rule 4

Consider two number cells `A` and `B`.  If `B` is equal to the difference of `A`
and the count of `A`'s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not `B`'s
neighbors, all of `A`'s unprobed neighbors that are not `B`'s neighbors are
flagged.

```
    ? ? ? ?      ! ? ? ?
    ? 3 1 2  =>  ! 3 1 2
	2 2 . .      2 2 . .
```

`A` and `B` are probed cells whose numbers are, respectively, 3 and 1.  The
count of `A`'s unprobed and flagged neighbors that are not `B`'s neighbors is
two (left `?`s).  Since `B == A - count` (`1 == 3 - 2`), the left unprobed cells
are flagged.


### Note

Interestingly, these complex rules can be integrated to one simple rule.
Analyze the code.


### One more thing

You can also play with a prepared map.

``` <!---sh-->
    ./prog ioccc.txt
```

The format of the text is:

```
    width height number-of-mines priorities-of-each-cell...
```

There are mines in a cell whose "priorities-of-each-cell" is less than
"number-of-mines".  (But the mine in the first-clicked cell is removed.)


### Bug fixes and Credits

The judges pointed out a bug of the original version that I submitted,
[prog.alt.c](%%REPO_URL%%/2020/endoh1/prog.alt.c).  Because this program does not provide a feature to
flag unprobed cells manually, we can do nothing if the number of unprobed cells
are equal to the number of mines remaining; [unwinnable.txt](unwinnable.txt) is
an example for such a case.

Thus, I implemented an additional rule to flag all unprobed cells in such a case
into the final version: [prog.c](%%REPO_URL%%/2020/endoh1/prog.c).

[Ilya Kurdyukov](../../authors.html#Ilya_Kurdyukov) also pointed out a warning
"ignoring return value of 'fscanf'" only when `-O3` is used.  So I changed the
code a little to pretend to use the return value of `fscanf(3)`.

[Don Yang](../../authors.html#Don_Yang) (omoikane) contributed another example map
[megumin.txt](megumin.txt) which is the Explosion Arch-Wizard from KonoSuba.
