## To build:

```sh
make
```

## To use:

```sh
./prog
```

## Try:

```sh
./run_clock
# And watch closely for 15-20 seconds
```

### Alternate code:

An alternate version of this entry, `prog.alt.c`, is provided.  This alternate code uses Unicode letters.

To compile this alternate version:

```sh
make alt
```

Use `prog.alt` as you would `prog` above.

## Judges' remarks:

You may be tempted to use a mirror. Resist the temptation! Try figuring out how the clock hands are drawn.
Can you change the program to make it draw a familiar (non-mirrored) clock face? Can you add the second hand?

When using the `run_clock` shell script, your perception of time might depend on what time it is.

## Author's remarks:

Prepare a mirror!

```sh
make clock
```

Note: You need to recompile it each run.
