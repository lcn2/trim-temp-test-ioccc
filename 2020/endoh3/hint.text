## Judges' comments:
### To use:

    make
    ./prog

### Try:

    ./run_clock
    # And watch closely for 15-20 seconds

### Selected Judges Remarks:

You may be tempted to use a mirror. Resist the temptation! Try figuring out how the clock hands are drawn.
Can you change the program to make it draw a familiar (non-mirrored) clock face? Can you add the second hand?

When using the `run_clock` shell script, your perception of time might depend on what time it is.

## Author's comments:
Prepare a mirror!

    $ make clock

Note: You need to recompile it each run.

prog.alt.c is an alternate version that uses Unicode letters, which was suggested by the judges.
