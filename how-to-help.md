# How to submit a fix to an IOCCC entry

If you see a problem with an IOCCC entry, first check the [known bugs](bugs.md)
file.  In some cases what you might think of as a bug is instead a known
feature.  In some cases the bug is known, but no fix has ever been submitted.
In other cases you may have found a new problem.

If you do have a fix, and the [known bugs](bugs.md) file **does not recommend
against fixing it**, then please consider opening a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) against the master
[branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the [ioccc-src/winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) repo.

BTW: A **problem** is not limited to the code itself.  Fixing typos in files
such as "_README.md_" files, fixing issues in a "_Makefile_", or otherwise
correcting an IOCCC winner is **VERY MUCH WELCOME**!  Please use the same
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process against
the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the
[ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) repo.

NOTE: some of the issues in the [bugs.md](/bugs.md) file includes just missing
files and we welcome these too!

**Please also help us fix typos and / or otherwise improve the write-up** of how
IOCCC winning entries are presented!

In any event we will happily add you to the
[thanks-for-fixes.md](/thanks-for-fixes.md) file for your help!

And of course, an IOCCC winner may update their own entries
(metadata as well as source code and any extra files) by opening a
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls)
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner)
repo.

Note that we're much more inclined to accept an author's fixes but the judges
have the final say in the matter.
