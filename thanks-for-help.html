<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to work for macOS.</p>
<p>The problem was to do with the way that the <code>read(2)</code>
function was redefined. With macOS the second arg needs to be a
<code>void *</code> and this also necessitated some casts to
<code>int</code> (on the second arg) in the call to
<code>write(2)</code> (in <code>read()</code>).</p>
<p>Later Cody corrected the mistake where the
<code>"hello, world!"</code> string was on one line rather than two
lines which the author told us (Landon) that they liked. Thus now it is
like the original where the first line ends with <code>"hell\</code> and
the second line starts with <code>o, world!\n"</code>.</p>
<p>By request, the original code is provided as <a
href="1984/anonymous/anonymous.alt.c">anonymous.alt.c</a> so that one
can look at it and the famous tattoo which we also include here:</p>

href="1984/decot/decot.c">1984/decot</a> (<a
href="1984/decot/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to not require
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> which some compilers like clang do not
support. Fixing <code>-traditional-cpp</code> is, as noted later on,
very complicated, but we encourage you to look at the alternate code
(which is the original code with a minor modification made by the
judges) and the fixed code, to see what had to be done.</p>
<p>Clang is also more strict about the type of args in
<code>main()</code> and this was also a problem that Cody fixed, making
it work with both clang and gcc.</p>
<p>These fixes worked fine in macOS but it turned out that in some cases
with clang in Linux it did not work so this had to be further fixed
which Cody also did. It is no longer clear what the problem was as in
fedora 38 with clang 16.0.6 the only difference is it causes additional
warnings but it seems to work just fine. It seems unlikely that a fix
was made just for warnings so it is presumed that there was another
problem so the change is kept in place.</p>
<p>A note about the fix is that the <code>#define</code>d macros that
were used still exist but most are not used; they are left in just to
make it look more like the original entry. Nevertheless those cannot be
used.</p>
<p>Later on Cody improved the fix to make it look rather more like the
original by bringing back an extern declaration (slightly changing it to
match the symbol that it is
i.e. <code>extern double floor(double);</code> instead of
<code>extern int floor;</code>) and also bringing back
<code>double (x1, y1) b;</code> and even this funny code that could be
kept in:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#define char k</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="ch">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="op">]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">char</span> x <span class="op">{</span><span class="kw">sizeof</span><span class="op">(</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>     <span class="dt">double</span><span class="op">(%</span>s<span class="op">,%</span>D<span class="op">)(*)())</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This does mean that there cannot be a second arg to
<code>main()</code> as clang requires that to be a <code>char **</code>
and the <code>char</code> redefined would not allow this. Some versions
of clang say that <code>main()</code> must have either 0, 2 or 3 args
but these versions do not object to 1 arg. However as the
<code>char</code> macro seems more obscure and it is possible that a new
version of clang will be even more strict the <code>int i</code>
parameter in <code>main()</code> was moved to be inside
<code>main()</code>, set to non-zero (setting <code>i</code> to 0 will
not work). This way <code>main()</code> has zero args.</p>
<p>Observe how on line 29 there is a call to <code>main()</code> which
does pass in a parameter. It has never been observed to be an error to
pass in too many parameters to a function (<code>main()</code> or
otherwise - it warns with other functions but does not appear to with
<code>main()</code>) but only that <code>main()</code> itself has a
certain number of args (in some versions) and that the first arg is an
<code>int</code> and the others are <code>char **</code>s. This is why
the arg was removed and the call to <code>main()</code> was not updated
beyond what had to be done to fix it for compilers that do not support
<code>-traditional-cpp</code>.</p>
<p>If the ANSI C committee or a new version of clang messes this up
(both of which seems possible) it is easy to fix but it is hoped that
this won’t happen.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> supplied a patch so that this
entry would compile with gcc - but not clang - or at least some
versions.</p>
<p>To see the difference from start to fixed:</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="1984/laman/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed this to not crash when no arg is specified. Note that
if the arg is not a positive number it will not do anything useful or
anything at all. This was fixed on 30 October 2023 after the bug status
was changed from INABIAF (it’s not a bug it’s a feature) to bug.</p>
<h2 id="mullender-index.html"><a name="1984_mullender"></a><a
href="1984/mullender/mullender.c">1984/mullender</a> (<a
href="1984/mullender/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> provided an <a
href="1984/mullender/mullender.alt.c">alternate version</a>, an improved
version of the judges, so that everyone can enjoy it with systems that
are not VAX/PDP. It moves at approximately the same speed as the
original did. We also refer you to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> as
there are some winning entries that also let one enjoy it (which through
trial and error was how the right speed was discovered) - with more to
them of course! The difference between the original is that it will
start over after it times out but that might not happen with the
original (might need you to press a key though this is not known for
sure).</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1984/mullender/gentab.c">gentab.c</a>
file, fixed to compile (and work, though see <a
href="#1984mullender-readmemd">bugs.html</a>) with modern systems and so
that it would create the proper array (it had unbalanced ’}’s), which
the author noted in their remarks (which Cody also found). As this file
uses the old header file <code>a.out.h</code> that is not available in
all modern systems, Cody found a copy of it as to what it should have
been at the time, in the fabulous <a
href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/tree/Research-Release">Unix
History Repo</a>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1"><a name="1985"></a>1985</h1>
<h2 id="applin-index.html"><a name="1985_applin"></a><a
href="1985/applin/applin.c">1985/applin</a> (<a
href="1985/applin/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p>Both <a href="#cody">Cody</a> and <a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> fixed
this; Yusuke got this to not crash and Cody fixed it to work with
macOS.</p>
<p>The crash was because it destructively rewrites string literals.
However with <code>strdup()</code> it’s safe.</p>
<p>The problem with macOS is that although it didn’t crash, it printed
<code>H????</code> in a seemingly infinite loop, each time printing
another <code>?</code>, and it probably would have until it runs out of
memory.</p>
<p>The fix for macOS is that there was no prototype for
<code>execlp()</code> and macOS has problems with missing prototypes for
some functions (this was also seen when Cody fixed <a
href="1984/anonymous/anonymous.c">1984/anonymous</a> for macOS as well).
As this is a one-liner the include of <code>unistd.h</code> was done in
the Makefile. Ironically this fix was discovered through Linux!</p>
<p>NOTE: originally this entry did not print a newline prior to
returning to the shell, after the output (despite having <code>\n</code>
in the string - can you figure out why?) but to make it more friendly to
users Cody made it print a <code>\n</code> prior to returning to the
shell. The original version does not have this change.</p>
<h2 id="august-index.html"><a name="1985_august"></a><a
href="1985/august/august.c">1985/august</a> (<a
href="1985/august/index.html">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a>, out of abundance of caution, added a second
arg to <code>main()</code> because some versions of clang object to the
number of args of <code>main()</code>, saying that it must be 0, 2 or 3.
The version this has been observed in does not actually object to 1 arg
but it is entirely possible that this changes so a second arg (that’s
not needed and is unused) has been added just in case.</p>
<p>Cody also added the script <a
href="1985/august/primes.sh">primes.sh</a> which allows one to check the
output for the first N prime numbers of the output, where N is either
the default or user specified. The inspiration was the previous ‘try’
command he gave to have fun with finding primes that might seem unusual
in a way.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1985/august/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
(which calls <code>primes.sh</code> whether <code>primes(6)</code> is
installed or not but it only does it once with the default value).</p>
<h2 id="lycklama-index.html"><a name="1985_lycklama"></a><a
href="1985/lycklama/lycklama.c">1985/lycklama</a> (<a
href="1985/lycklama/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with modern compilers.
In the past one could get away with defining some macro to
<code>#define</code> and then use <code>#foo</code> to have the same
effect as using <code>#define</code> but this does not work in modern
systems so Cody changed the <code>#o</code> lines to
<code>#define</code>. Also <code>unistd.h</code> had to be
<code>#include</code>d.</p>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> provided some useful information that
amounts to an alternate version that Cody added. See the index.html for
details.</p>
<p>Cody also provided the <a
href="1985/lycklama/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> script.</p>
<h2 id="shapiro-index.html"><a name="1985_shapiro"></a><a
href="1985/shapiro/shapiro.c">1985/shapiro</a> (<a
href="1985/shapiro/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the alt code which allows one to
resize the maze and he also added the <a
href="1985/shapiro/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> script that randomly
selects sizes (five times) and compiles and runs it. After the five runs
it prompts you to enter a number, in an infinite loop, exiting if any
non-digits are in input (this includes negative numbers which in the
code actually sets it back to 39, the default).</p>
<h2 id="sicherman-index.html"><a name="1985_sicherman"></a><a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.c">1985/sicherman</a> (<a
href="1985/sicherman/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this <em>very twisted entry</em> to
not require <code>-traditional-cpp</code>. Fixing
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> is, as noted later on, very complicated,
but Cody would like to refer you to the original file <a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.orig.c">sicherman.orig.c</a> and he
suggests that you then compare it to <a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.c">sicherman.c</a> for some good old
C-fashioned fun (alternatively, see below explanation)!</p>
<p>Later on Cody improved the fix so that it looks much more like the <a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.c">original entry</a>. He did this
several more times and it’s as close to the original as one can get
without causing compiler errors.</p>
<p>To get this to all work the following changes were made. If you
really want to understand this Cody provides the following. First run
the following command from the directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> diff_orig_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then read the following (you might also wish to look at the code
in an editor with syntax highlighting):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because of the macros <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> in the
original code, the args to <code>main()</code> were actually not what
they appear: the only arg that existed in <code>main()</code> was
<code>Manual</code>. Thus it now looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main<span class="op">(</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/*  C program. (If you don&#39;t</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"> *  understand it look it</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"> *  up.) (In the C*/</span> Manual<span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">{</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>The macros <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> were changed to
lower case. This is because it felt like the <code>C=" ..</code>’ part
in <code>subr()</code> would be better to be upper case as it talks
about the language. Also in the second <a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.alt2.c">alternate version</a> (the first
being the original code) which is in case a new version of clang ever
objects to only one arg in <code>main()</code> (which is not out of the
realm of possibility), <code>main()</code> can have <code>C</code> as
<code>argc</code> to <code>main()</code> so it would read like it once
did: <code>C manual</code> albeit with a <code>,</code> separating the
two. The <a href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.alt2.c">second alternate</a>
version is compiled in case the first does not. Originally the macros
were kept the same and the <code>C</code> in <code>subr()</code> was
<code>c</code>. It feels better (in some ways) to make it so that the
<code>C</code> for the language is upper case though, and since it
actually translated to <code>/**/</code> it can just be <code>c</code>,
not <code>C</code>. The <code>V</code> was changed to <code>v</code> to
be the same case as <code>c</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code:</p>

<p>because of the missing <code>"</code> at the end of the line and
because <code>_|_</code> is not a function call.</p>
<p>The <code>\"</code> had to be done to keep the <code>"</code>s there
though the string could be broken up into multiple <code>"</code> pairs
instead; that seemed less authentic, however. Notice how the last line
of code in that function is the same as before and actually that there
aren’t that many changes in the function at all!</p>
<p>Notice also that the parameter <code>C</code> remained the same due
to the macro <code>C</code> rename to <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>char</code>s <code>_</code> and <code>__</code> in
<code>main()</code> were copied to file scope so that
<code>subr()</code> could actually compile but this does not affect the
ones in <code>main()</code>. Why is this? You tell us!</p></li>

<p>Note how numerous of the macros (though two changed in case) can
still be used but some cannot be. Can you figure out why? Why too is it
that the <code>subr()</code> function is called but it appears that some
of the code in that function is also in <code>main()</code> in the
<code>while</code> condition? What happens if you remove it from
<code>main()</code>? What happens if you remove it from
<code>subr()</code> or don’t even bother calling
<code>subr()</code>?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additional code was added in case the fix cannot be compiled by some
compilers should they object to <code>main()</code> having only one arg.
This version will automatically be compiled if the entry fails to
compile for some reason but one can compile it manually as
<code>make alt</code> in which case it’ll be compiled as
<code>sicherman.alt</code> (if it’s done because <a
href="1985/sicherman/sicherman.c">sicherman.c</a> fails to compile it
will be built as <code>sicherman</code> as part of the
<code>sicherman</code> rule).</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1985/sicherman/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="1985/sicherman/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> scripts.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile and work with clang
(it already worked with gcc). The problem was that clang is more strict
about the type of second arg to <code>main()</code>. However simply
changing it to a <code>char **</code> and updating the <code>*s</code>
to <code>**s</code> caused a segfault. By adding a new variable,
<code>char *t</code>, initialising it to <code>s</code> and then using
<code>t</code> instead of <code>s</code> it compiles and runs
successfully under clang and gcc.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> got this to compile and work with clang and
gcc. He noted that he tried to keep the ASCII art as close to the
original as possible. The line lengths are the same but some spaces had
to be changed to non-spaces.</p>
<p>This fix was very interesting and quite amusing, showing up problems
with two different compilers. This is a brief summary but much more is
explained in the <a
href="1986/marshall/compilers.html">compilers.html</a> file, giving
which compilers had which problems in which systems: the optimiser being
enabled in one compiler let it work but broke it in the other; and
disabling it would let it work in the one that didn’t work but suddenly
the one that worked wouldn’t work. And by ‘not working’ it did not work
in more than one way and for different platforms it had other problems
as well.</p>
<p>This problem was only after getting clang to compile, of course. It
did not compile it because it is more strict about the second and third
args to <code>main()</code> and the third arg was an
<code>int</code>.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read the <a
href="1986/marshall/compilers.html">compilers.html</a> file to see how
odd this problem was and what Cody did to fix it, if nothing else but
for entertainment!</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> noticed and fixed a funny mistake in the

single line. The code being longer (in 1986 a one liner could be longer)
was split to three lines to avoid problems with news and mail but as it
was the ‘Best one liner’ it is now one line.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1986/stein/stein.sh">stein.sh</a> script

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this so that it does not require

entry <em>very twisted</em>; fixing <code>-traditional-cpp</code> is, as
noted earlier, very complicated, but we encourage you to look at <a

<p>Some of the changes required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of using the <code>c_</code>, defined as
<code>c_(cc)c cc=</code>, like:</p>
<pre><code>  c_(+)o

  /* ... */

  :c_(+)&#39; &#39;-1;
  }}c_(&amp;)&#39;z&#39;+5;</code></pre>
<p>use:</p>
<pre><code>  :c +=o[c&amp;__LINE__-007];

  /* ... */

  :c+=&#39; &#39;-1;
  }}c&amp;=&#39;z&#39;+5;</code></pre>
<p>Observe however that this macro is still used in the code like:</p>
<pre><code> main(;c_(=(*cc);*cc++)c,for);</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Instead of code like:</p>
<pre><code>  main(0xb+(c&gt;&gt;5),C_(s))
  _&#39;\v&#39;
  :__ _&#39;\f&#39;:
  main(c,C_(s));</code></pre>
<p>use instead:</p>
<pre><code>  main(;c_(=(*cc);*cc++)c,for);
  #define _O(s)s
  switch(0xb+(c&gt;&gt;5)){
  _&#39;\v&#39;
  :__ _&#39;\f&#39;:
  switch(c){;</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The macro:</p>
<pre><code>  #define C_(sand)_O(sand)witch</code></pre>
<p>could not be used like:</p>
<pre><code>  C_(s));_</code></pre>
<p>to create:</p>
<pre><code>  switch);_</code></pre>
<p>and neither could the macro:</p>
<pre><code>  #define O_(O)_O(O)stem(ccc(</code></pre>
<p>be used like:</p>
<pre><code>  :O_(sy)&quot;;kkt -oa, dijszdijs QQ&quot;))_C</code></pre>
<p>to create:</p>
<pre><code>  :system(ccc(&quot;;kkt -oa, dijszdijs QQ&quot;));return</code></pre></li>
<li><p>And of course as noted two strings had to be
<code>strdup()</code>d.</p></li>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added back the documented checks for invalid
input which no longer worked and instead resulted in either accepting
the level, whether or not it was a number or out of range (see below on
range). For the move it entered an infinite loop, prompting the player
with <code>"You:"</code> but not letting the player input anything so
that the screen was flooded and the game could not be played.</p>
<p>For both the level and move it did a <code>scanf()</code> with a
<code>%d</code> specifier but this resulted in, if invalid input, either
proceeding (for the level), presumably incorrectly done as it might not
even be a number (see below) or printing <code>"You:"</code> in an
infinite loop, expecting input again but not letting the player input
anything, both as noted above.</p>
<p>The fix is that now the specifier is a <code>%2s</code> for a
<code>char A[100]</code> (yes 100 is overkill; there’s no good reason
for it here: it was just arbitrarily selected).</p>
<p>For the level if <code>atoi(A)&gt;10||&lt;0</code> (see next part) or
<code>!isdigit(*A)</code> it goes back and prompts again. The level is
checked for <code>&gt;=0||&lt;=10</code>, perhaps incorrectly or perhaps
not, because in the code that variable is checked for
<code>&lt;10</code> and if that is the case it is incremented by 2. I do
not know the rules of the game and neither do I know what the author had
in mind so I chosen 10 as the maximum.</p>
<p>As for the move the <code>do..while</code> loop works properly now
that it does it in two steps (<code>scanf("%2s", A); m=atoi(A);</code>)
so there’s no need to check the value explicitly, again. Thus it will
prompt until valid input is entered, but only showing
<code>"You:"</code> once per prompting.</p>
<p>In the case of the level prior to prompting for the level it does a
<code>*A='\0';</code> and in the case of the move it does it after the
<code>m=atoi(A);</code>. This is done this way because the check for the
value of the level (<code>atoi(A)</code>) is done in the
<code>if()</code> that also checks for a digit (though it does
<code>(u=atoi(A))&gt;10||u&lt;0</code> first, thus checking the level,
and <code>|| !isdigit(*A)</code>). Of course since <code>-</code> is not
a digit the <code>&lt;0</code> is superfluous but it’s done anyway. If
that <code>if</code> is 1 then it immediately goes back to the prompting
of the level.</p>
<p>But for the move it can happen after due to the fact the condition of
the <code>do..while</code> loop will take care of things.</p>
<p>Cody also made this ever so slightly like the original code by adding
back the <code>#define D define</code> even though it’s unused. This was
done for both versions as well (the one with the board and the one
without, the entry itself with the size constraints of the contest).</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems. The problem
was
<code>'assignment to cast is illegal, lvalue casts are not supported'</code>.
For the original file see the index.html file. Unfortunately this ruins
some symmetry. To try and resolve this as much as possible at first code
was commented out but later on the commented out code was removed and
another part changed so that, although it has some code no longer there,
it has a closer match in symmetry and since the code was commented out
it’s probably not a big deal to have it removed instead as it does look
more symmetrical now.</p>
<p>Cody also added to the Makefile <code>-include stdio.h</code> in the
nowadays very unlikely(?) but nevertheless suggested case that
<code>putchar()</code> is not available.</p>

fix from the original entry. There was another problem to resolve as
well, however.</p>

<p>cannot form <code>fork())</code> in modern C compilers. Since it was
not done through a macro it was simply changed to be
<code>fork()</code>, rather than adding a new macro.</p>
<p>The other problem that could not be resolved by the
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> was that modern compilers do not allow
directives like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="#cb24-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#define _ define</span></span>

<p>so Cody changed the lines to be in the form of:</p>

<p>However, to keep the entry as close to as possible in look, Cody kept
the <code>_</code> macro in place it’s just no longer used.</p>
<p>See the index.html file for details on the original code, provided as

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems. It did not
compile with clang because it requires the second and third args of
<code>main()</code> to be <code>char **</code> but even before that with
gcc it printed garbage and then crashed.</p>
<p>After fixing it for clang by changing the very <code>main()</code>
(in fact it called itself up to 12 times!) to call the new function
<code>pain()</code> (chosen because it’s a pain that clang requires
these args to be <code>char **</code> :-), which is just as recursive,
with the correct args it now works with both gcc and clang.</p>
<p>Later Cody improved the fix to make it look a bit more like the
original, using K&amp;R style functions, and trying to match the format
as best as possible of what <code>main()</code> used to look like but
without the full body that cannot exist as it once did. The format of
<code>pain()</code> is exactly like how <code>main()</code> was as it’s
the same code. Additionally, <code>main()</code> returns
<code>!pain(...)</code> like <code>main()</code> used to do to itself
and <code>pain()</code> does now.</p>

provided because not doing so would be tampering with the entry too
much. It would work but it would not show the same creativity and
cleverness.</p>
<p>The original entry exploits a fun mis-feature that works with gcc but
not clang. This resulted in a change of rules which is another reason to
not modify the original. See the index.html file for details on the
alternate code.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Cody was twisted enough to point out (though to be fair he
felt sick doing this) that with a slight modification this entry can be
C++ instead. We don’t thank him for this ghastly point! :-)</p>

<p>The <a href="1988/westley/westley.alt.c">original version</a>,

encourage you to try the alternate version to see what happens with
current compilers! See the index.html files for details.</p>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

entry as seeing the code with the result at once is far more
beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> got this to work with modern systems. The
main issues were that an <code>#include</code> had to be added along

was also fixed in <a href="1989/fubar/fubar.sh">fubar.sh</a>.</p>
<p>A strange problem occurred where if one made modifications to the C

was resolved by:</p>

<p>Cody also ‘modernised’ the script to use <code>bash</code> and fixed

<p>To prevent annoying output to <code>/dev/tty</code> we changed the

href="#cody">Cody</a> removed the ill-famed
<code>useless use of cat</code> to shut <a

it ill-famed? Because there is no such thing as a useless cat, that’s
why! For instance, the fact they even exist is proof that the Earth is
<strong>NOT</strong> flat: because if it was they would have pushed
everything off it by now! :-) They’re also a great joy to all
ailurophiles and yes they most certainly do have a personality and they
can be very sociable.</p>
<p>Whilst he was at it, Cody made it so that one need not run the alt
script or alt code directly, to match that of the main entry. As we
simulate the functionality anyway, and since one may still run the code

out well.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed an infinite loop where the program
would print the same thing over and over again, flooding the screen. The
problem is that there was a <code>for</code> loop that by necessity had
to not have an increment stage but the pointer only got updated in the
<code>if</code> path (in the loop itself).</p>
<p>Cody also provided the <a href="1989/ovdluhe/try.sh">try.sh</a>
script which runs the program four times on three files to show the
different output. It doesn’t run the program on each file four times in
a row but rather does it on each file and starts over, doing it four
times, to help with hopefully allowing different output.</p>
<p>Cody also provided an <a href="1989/ovdluhe/ovdluhe.alt.c">alternate

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> and <a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> fixed this
entry: Yusuke fixed this to compile with gcc and Cody fixed it for clang
and made some other fixes as well.</p>
<p>To get it to work with clang the variable <code>a</code> had to not
be the third argument to <code>main()</code> but instead be a variable
in <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed a segfault and made it so the that the high score
file would work (it was not even being created but it was supposed to
be). This was happening due to a file pointer being declared as a
<code>long</code> and more significantly is the command in
<code>popen(3)</code> was not correct.</p>
<p>Another problem Cody fixed was that the terminal was left in an
insane state where you could not type ‘<code>u</code>’ and echo was
completely disabled.</p>
<p>Cody later on fixed the alt version, provided by the author, so that
it would compile with clang, not abort (with an alarm), would have the
tetriminos fall, it would write to the high score file (the command to
<code>popen(3)</code> was incorrect here too but as can be seen it
differs from the submitted version), could use <code>stty</code>
properly (and thus turn on echo again - it did not work because it was
in the <code>popen(3)</code> call rather than using
<code>system(3)</code>), a couple compiler errors and various other
things, so that now the alt version, which is better, can be used.</p>
<p>Although we appreciate the help here, he cynically noted that he had
to have an IOCCC <a

course was not his only reason :-) )</p>

href="1989/westley/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for clang, except that two
versions generated by the program cannot be compiled by clang due to
inherent defects in the compiler and how the entry works. This is an
<strong>incredibly hard</strong> one to fix for clang whilst still being
compilable with gcc (and gcc can compile every generated version with
the fix) and even if one fixes it to compile with clang it does not mean
that any other version will compile! It is, however, possible to get
clang to work with two versions generated, <code>ver0</code> and
<code>ver1</code>, though <code>ver0</code> is actually just the main
entry (but still generated by the program itself).</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the way this entry works if it is even possible
to get all versions to compile with clang it will take heavy
modifications to get all versions to compile with clang. Cody almost got
it and knows how it functions but even getting it just about there
caused compilation errors in gcc so it might just not be possible.</p>
<p>The way it was fixed might be hard to see and describe but this is an
attempt. Because <code>main()</code>’s args were all <code>int</code>s,
<code>main()</code> had to call a new function which is allowed to have
args as <code>int</code> (instead of <code>main()</code>’s args being
int and the rest being <code>char **</code>) but this is not as straight
forward as it is for other entries (if you look at the code you might
see what is meant; the function called is <code>pain()</code>).</p>
<p>The args of <code>main()</code> had to be set to the right type but
only three args, <strong>not four</strong>, even though the original
program has four args. This is because not all versions of clang support
four args and that is one of the issues with version 2 and 3 as it
generates <code>main()</code> to have four args and the wrong type, all
<code>int</code>s.</p>
<p>In the call to the new function, <code>pain()</code>, from
<code>main()</code>, one of the <code>char **</code>s is used twice,
once as <code>argc</code> with bitwise AND with 2, naturally first being
cast to an <code>int</code> (<code>(int)ABBA&amp;2</code>), and once as
a <code>char **</code>, the fourth arg to <code>pain()</code> (yes even
though <code>pain()</code> takes all <code>int</code>s).</p>
<p>The argc,, meanwhile, <code>tang</code>, is used once and the second
arg, <code>char **gnat</code> is used once (observe how
<code>tang</code> is <code>gnat</code> spelt backwards as this is one of
the things that makes this a masterpiece and very hard if not impossible
to fix completely). Fortunately it is not actually necessary to use all
four args (of <code>main()</code>) in the call which might or might not
be surprising, especially as it uses one of the args, a
<code>char **</code>, instead of an <code>int</code> (through casts),
twice rather than just passing in for the fourth arg (the fourth arg
passed in is the third arg to <code>main()</code>).</p>
<p>This program heavily uses recursion and depending on the number of
args it will print out output normally, ROT13 it, show it backwards or
both. Along with the ROT13 and reversed output of the code, it is the
<strong>comments that create the names and the rest of the
code!</strong>: sometimes it is the word backwards, other times it is
the ROT13 of it and other times it is both, both for comments and
otherwise. Trying to change comments can be very difficult though it was
done when clang could almost compile every version if not actually
compile all versions. Unfortunately when this was done it caused other
systems to have additional compilation errors so it seems highly
unlikely that version 2 and 3 can work for clang (versions 0 and 1
can).</p>
<p>Despite the risks of changing names this was done and indeed by
necessity. Comments might have been changed but it is no longer known if
that happened only in the working on version 2 and 3 or if in the fix
for clang as well as version 0 and 1.</p>
<p>To make use of this several scripts were added by Cody.</p>
<p>The <a href="1989/westley/compile.sh">compile.sh</a> script that
removes the generated code, rebuilds the program and regenerates the
other code and then compiles it will work for compilers like gcc and one
can then use the <a href="1989/westley/try.sh">try.sh</a> script to see
example input and output.</p>
<p>The <code>compile.sh</code> script allows one to specify the compiler
with the <code>CC</code> environmental variable; see the index.html for
details.</p>

improved output though he has no way to test the compilers in question

<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> and <a href="#cody">Cody</a> in
conjunction fixed this for modern systems (both fixed a different
compiler error but more fixes were also made).</p>
<p>Yusuke added the comma operator for a binary expression with
<code>free(3)</code> which is is a compiler error because
<code>free()</code> returns void. Cody then made it slightly more like
the original in this way by redefining <code>free</code> to have the
comma operator itself.</p>
<p>Cody fixed another compiler error by removing the erroneous prototype
to <code>fopen()</code>. Cody also changed a <code>char *</code> used
for file I/O to be a proper <code>FILE *</code> and fixed a typo in <a
href="1990/dds/LANDER.BAS">LANDER.BAS</a>.</p>
<p>Cody also made this use <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dg-index.html"><a name="1990_dg"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems. There were
two problems to be resolved.</p>
<p>One can no longer do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#define d define</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><a href="#cb29-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb29-3"><a href="#cb29-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#</span><span class="er">d b12(x) 12 x</span></span>
<span id="cb29-4"><a href="#cb29-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb29-5"><a href="#cb29-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/* etc. */</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>so the use of <code>#d</code> is now instead <code>#define</code>
(the macro was originally deleted but later Cody added it back to make
it more like the original).</p>
<p>The second problem was suggested by the judges at the time of
judging, to do with if the C preprocessor botches single quotes in cpp
expansion.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1990/dg/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<h2 id="jaw-index.html"><a name="1990_jaw"></a><a
href="1990/jaw/jaw.c">1990/jaw</a> (<a
href="1990/jaw/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the script to work properly in modern
environments including writing to and extracting from
<code>stdout</code> and relying on the exit code in the commands to
allow for <code>&amp;&amp; ...</code>.</p>
<p>He also changed the <code>perror(3)</code> call to
<code>fprintf(3)</code> because in macOS when errno is 0 it shows what
looks like an error.</p>
<p>He added the <a href="1990/jaw/try.sh">try.sh</a> to run the commands
that we suggested at the time.</p>
<p>NOTE: as <code>btoa</code> is not common we used a ruby script from
<a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> but with a minor fix applied by Cody that
made the program just show <code>oops</code> twice from invalid input
but which now works.</p>
<h2 id="pjr-index.html"><a name="1990_pjr"></a><a
href="1990/pjr/pjr.c">1990/pjr</a> (<a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a href="1990/pjr/pjr.alt.c">alt
code</a> which was suggested by the judges in the case that your
compiler cannot compile <code>X=g()...</code> but it actually does
something else and is recommended by the author as well.</p>
<h2 id="scjones-index.html"><a name="1990_scjones"></a><a
href="1990/scjones/scjones.c">1990/scjones</a> (<a
href="1990/scjones/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> suggested <code>-ansi</code> to get the
entry to compile due to trigraphs and <a href="#cody">Cody</a> suggested
<code>-trigraphs</code>. Both work but we used Yusuke’s idea.</p>
<p>Cody added the <a href="1990/scjones/try.sh">try.sh</a> script to
show exactly what the entry does.</p>
<h2 id="tbr-index.html"><a name="1990_tbr"></a><a

href="1990/tbr/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to work with modern compilers;
<code>exit(3)</code> returns void but the function was used in a binary
expression so this wouldn’t even compile.</p>
<p>Cody also changed the code to use <code>fgets()</code> instead of
<code>gets()</code> so one would not get a warning about the use of
<code>gets(3)</code> at linking time or execution, the latter of which
was causing confusing output due to the warning being interspersed with
the program’s interactive output.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cody fixed the shortened version provided by the author
in the same way as the original entry, first the compile fix and then
later on making it look more like the original by redefining
<code>exit</code> and also redefining <code>gets()</code> to be
<code>fgets()</code> in the same way that the original entry is. This
way the <a href="1990/tbr/index.html#alternate-code">alt version</a> is
equivalent in function, like the author intended, but more compact.</p>
<h2 id="theorem-index.html"><a name="1990_theorem"></a><a
href="1990/theorem/theorem.c">1990/theorem</a> (<a
href="1990/theorem/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with modern
systems.</p>
<p>He also fixed some bugs that impacted the usability of this program
including some segfaults under modern systems (and possibly in some
cases earlier systems) with this entry. Originally we noted that the 4
trailing args ‘0 0 0 0’ were required on systems that dump core when
NULL is dereferenced but this problem showed itself in modern systems
even with the 4 ‘0 0 0 0’. He also fixed a segfault if not enough args
are specified and fixed the code so that the generated
<code>fibonacci.c</code> actually works; before it just printed
<code>0</code> over and over again (since it did not work anyway a
segfault prevention was added here). He also fixed some array addressing
(some of which might not be strictly necessary but as he was testing the
<code>fibonacci.c</code> bug he ended up changing it anyway).</p>
<p>BTW: why can’t the fix:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(</span>a<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">]==</span>NULL<span class="op">||</span>a<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">]==</span>NULL<span class="op">||</span>a<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">]==</span>NULL<span class="op">||</span>a<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">4</span><span class="op">]==</span>NULL<span class="op">||</span>a<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">5</span><span class="op">]==</span>NULL<span class="op">)</span> <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>be changed to just test the value of <code>A</code> when
<code>a</code> is argv and <code>A</code> is argc?</p>
<p>Cody also changed the code to use <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<p>Since this program is so incredible the extra fixes were deemed worth
having and this is why it was done.</p>
<p>Cody later disabled a warning in the Makefile that proved to be a
problem only with clang in Linux but which was defaulting to an error.
This way was the simplest way to deal with the problem in question due
to the way the entry works.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1990/theorem/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
which shows the original program and some of the programs it
generates.</p>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> pointed out that <code>atof</code>
nowadays needs <code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> which was used in
order to get this to work initially (prior to this output was there but
incomplete).</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the paths in the Makefile so that this
would build in Linux (it worked fine in macOS).</p>
<p>He also changed the Makefile to use <code>bash</code> not
<code>zsh</code> as not all systems have <code>zsh</code> and the
Makefile actually sets <code>SHELL</code> to <code>bash</code>.</p>
<h2 id="westley-index.html-3"><a name="1990_westley"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems. It had
<code>1s</code> in places for a <code>short int</code> which was changed
to just <code>1</code>. Since it’s instructional to see the differences
he has provided an alternate version, <a
href="1990/westley/westley.alt.c">westley.alt.c</a>, which is the
original code.</p>
<p>He also changed the <code>argc</code> to be an <code>int</code>, not
a <code>char</code>, even though it might often be the same (for the
purpose of <code>clang</code>?).</p>
<p>He also fixed the code to not enter an infinite loop if arg is a
number not &gt; 0 and to not crash if no arg is specified.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1990/westley/try.sh">try.sh</a>
script.</p>
<p>The alt code did NOT have arg checks added as it is actually a copy
of the original code.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added <a href="1991/ant/ant.alt.c">alt
code</a> that will be a bit easier to use for those familiar with vim in
the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>0</code> to go to first column.</li>
<li>Use <code>$</code> to go to last column.</li>
<li>Hit ESC to go back to command mode (instead of form-feed,
ctrl-L).</li>
<li>Use <code>w</code> to go forwards one word.</li>
<li>Use <code>b</code> to go backwards one word.</li>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems. There were
two invalid operands to binary expression (<code>char *</code> and
<code>void</code> and <code>int</code> and <code>void</code>) to resolve
and additionally a mis-feature of the C pre-processor which no longer
works had to be changed as well in order to get this to compile. In
particular the macro <code>C</code>, defined as <code>C =G</code> to
make <code>+=</code> and similar operators no longer works. The invalid
operands to binary expressions were resolved with the comma
operator.</p>
<p>Later on, Cody added back the macro <code>#define D define</code> to
make it look ever so slightly more like the original, even though it’s
unused.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1991/brnstnd/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
and <a href="1991/brnstnd/try.txt">try.txt</a> which the script
uses.</p>

href="1991/buzzard/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this so that the coordinates being
specified would not crash the program. This happened because the
function that calls <code>atoi(3)</code> took an arg without any type
specified and as an implicit <code>int</code> it was not a
<code>char *</code> which crashed the program in modern systems.</p>
<p>Cody also made the file name in the code (which is the default maze
file) not hard-coded but instead be <code>__FILE__</code>.</p>
<p>Finally Cody added the <a
href="1991/buzzard/index.html#alternate-code">alternate version</a>
which will possibly feel more at home with those familiar with vi(m) (it
certainly does feel more at home with him): <code>k</code> for forward,
<code>h</code> for left and <code>l</code> for right. This version also
has a more useful way to exit, just entering <code>q</code> followed by
enter, rather than completing or killing the program.</p>

<p>As some systems like macOS can be particular about not declaring
functions <a href="#cody">Cody</a> added to the Makefile some
<code>-include</code> options. These appear to not be strictly necessary
but it was done due to other syscalls being a problem not being declared
first.</p>
<h2 id="dds-index.html-1"><a name="1991_dds"></a><a
href="1991/dds/dds.c">1991/dds</a> (<a
href="1991/dds/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a segfault that prevented this entry
from working in any condition and he also made it work for clang. He
also added checks for NULL <code>FILE *</code>s. Furthermore he changed
it so that the C from the BASIC uses <code>fgets()</code>, not
<code>gets()</code>. For the magic of clang and <code>fgets()</code> see
below.</p>
<p>Clang (at least in some systems?) defaults to having
<code>-Werror</code> and the code that the entry generates had some
warnings that were causing compilation to fail if <code>cc</code> is
clang as it just ran <code>cc a.c</code>. It ran it by what was once
<code>system(q-6);</code> but if <code>cc</code> is clang like in macOS
this is not enough.</p>
<p>(Cody said he stupidly did the below manually until he thought to
write a simple program to do the conversions which he used for
<code>gets()</code> to <code>fgets()</code> and for making the generated
code return a value from <code>main()</code> rather than just
<code>return;</code>).</p>
<p>The following had to be added to the string <code>s</code> (which to
fix the segfault was changed from <code>char*s</code> to
<code>char s[]</code>):</p>
<pre><code>!.Xop.fssps!.Xop.sfuvso.uzqf!.Xop.jnqmjdju.gvodujpo.efdmbsbujpo</code></pre>
<p>and then the call to <code>system()</code> had to be changed to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>system<span class="op">(</span>q<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">69</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>An important point is that the placement of this string in the
<code>s</code> array does matter. This is because of the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb33-1"><a href="#cb33-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">*</span>o<span class="op">=</span>fopen<span class="op">(</span>q<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span><span class="st">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which means the file name that translates to <code>a.c</code> has to
be at the end of the string. Thus the end of the string actually looks
like:</p>
<pre><code>!.Xop.fssps!.Xop.sfuvso.uzqf!.Xop.jnqmjdju.gvodujpo.efdmbsbujpo!b/d</code></pre>
<p>But then there is the matter of getting the C to use
<code>fgets(3)</code>. As can be seen above it’s not as simple as
changing <code>gets(3)</code> to <code>fgets(3)</code>. This was more
magic characters that had to be updated and some added. The C code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb35"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb35-1"><a href="#cb35-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>atoi<span class="op">(</span>gets<span class="op">(</span>b<span class="op">))</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>is in the string:</p>
<pre><code>bupj)hfut)c**</code></pre>
<p>which was changed to be (in C):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb37-1"><a href="#cb37-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>atoi<span class="op">(</span>fgets<span class="op">(</span>b<span class="op">,</span><span class="dv">99</span><span class="op">,</span>stdin<span class="op">))</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which in the program is:</p>
<pre><code>bupj)ghfut)c-::-tuejo**</code></pre>
<p>That’s fine and well but since the code does not include
<code>stdio.h</code> there obviously would be a compilation error. Thus
the compiler line had to updated to have <code>-include stdio.h</code>
which in this rotated string is:</p>
<pre><code>.jodmvef!tuejp/i</code></pre>
<p>which had to be added after:</p>
<pre><code>efdmbsbujpo!</code></pre>
<p>which is the end of the warning disabled for clang as described
above.</p>
<p>But now the <code>system(q-69);</code> had to be changed to
<code>system(q-86);</code>.</p>
<p>Then, later on, Cody discovered that in some systems, clang triggers
even more warnings so this had to be corrected too so the string was
updated again and the <code>system(q-86)</code> had to be changed to
<code>system(q-104)</code>.</p>
<p>But then to prevent the need for disabling a warning and to be more
correct code, the generated code was changed to <code>return 1;</code>
rather than just <code>return;</code>. Thus in full the string
became:</p>

<p>and it now is <code>system(q-87);</code>.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this is the last time the string has to be updated
to work with all versions of clang but if not the above is how it
works.</p>
<p>With these changes in place it will compile and work with both gcc
and clang and the C code generated will use <code>fgets(3)</code>, not
<code>gets(3)</code>, therefore removing the annoying warnings. Note
that the array passed to <code>fgets(3)</code> is an int but that was
the same for <code>gets()</code> and is not necessary to update to a
<code>char[]</code>.</p>
<p>The key to the string is that it rotates the character by
<code>+1</code>. This was not immediately clear until reading the
author’s remarks so there was an alt version that was something of a
kludge, running <code>make a</code> instead but that was removed.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed a typo in LANDER.BAS and made it so that if a file
could not be opened for reading or a file could not be opened for
writing it would not crash. The definition of whether that should be a
bug to fix or a feature to not fix was pondered and changed numerous
times and ultimately that problem with this entry was fixed. It has not
been done in all.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> made it look much more like the original
entry even after the fix that increased the count in characters from 80
to 106, getting it back down to just 85 (and later back down to 80, see
below).</p>
<p>This was done by redefining <code>main</code> at the compiler line so
that it looks like the original where one didn’t have to worry about the
type of args of main() and there were other fewer restrictions and also
by removing a cast that was not strictly necessary (this does create a
new warning:
<code>ordered comparison between pointer and integer ('char **' and 'int')</code>
but it works just <code>fine</code>).</p>
<p>That was <code>fine</code> as well but Cody decided to drop it back
down to its original 80 which also resolved the warning described above.
This was by more clever use of the Makefile which now has a
<code>-DB=(int)b</code> so that <code>B</code> can be used in place
where <code>(int)b</code> used to be necessary.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1991/fine/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
which feeds the program some fun input for fun but mostly different
output. He added a great string from Brian Westley and Cody also added
several of his own (can you figure out exactly which ones? :-) )</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed it so that the messages that show if
you won or lost will be seen after the end of the game. The reason it
did not work before is curses was ended at the end of the program which
clears the screen. To make it look most like the original entry Cody
left the message before ending curses in and printed another message of
the same kind after <code>endwin()</code> was called with the exception
that he added a newline at the end of the screen to be more user
friendly.</p>
<p>Cody also added <a href="1991/rince/index.html#alternate-code">two
alt versions</a>, one to remove the maximum number of moves you may make
and another to let you configure the maximum number of moves, even if
that is making it harder to win. Naturally the above fix was applied to
these versions too.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a segfault in this program which
prevented it from working. The problem was that the read-only char array
<code>char *z[]</code> was being written to. The fix was to change it to
<code>char z[][100]</code> in two spots (see if you can determine why
two places, not one!). Why 100 when the longest string is &lt; 100?
Because a shorter value caused strange output and it’s easier to just
choose a larger value that works without having to find the correct
value.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed the <code>ttt.sh</code> script that prevented the
game from working and he also improved it so that warnings/errors/about
to compile messages are not shown unless the <code>-e</code> option is
used. This is because the errors being shown kind of ruins the
experience. Finally he made it pass <a
href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">ShellCheck</a>.</p>
<p>Cody also added the alt version which is based on the author’s
remarks, a version that supposedly (:-) ) always wins.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed the make clobber rule where a file was left lying
about when it should have been removed.</p>

<h2 id="adrian-index.html"><a name="1992_adrian"></a><a
href="1992/adrian/adrian.c">1992/adrian</a> (<a
href="1992/adrian/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the code so that it will try opening
the file the code was compiled from (<code>__FILE__</code>), not
<code>adgrep.c</code>, as the latter does not exist: <code>adgrep</code>
is simply a link to <code>adrian</code> as <code>adgrep</code> is what
the program was submitted as but the entry’s winning source file is
<code>adrian.c</code>.</p>
<p>Not fixing the above problem would have also caused the program to
crash if no arg was specified as the file doesn’t exist. In making the
above fix, at first the change to check for a <code>NULL</code> file was
added. Then it was noticed that the problem is that
<code>adgrep.c</code> was an incorrect reference that never existed and
it was never fixed in any of the files, not the code or the
documentation, and thus was entirely incorrect code. A fun fact is that
one can do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>W<span class="op">=</span> fopen<span class="op">(</span>wc<span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">?</span> V<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">]</span> <span class="op">:</span> __FILE__<span class="op">,</span><span class="st">&quot;rt&quot;</span><span class="op">);</span><span class="cf">if</span><span class="op">(!</span>W<span class="op">)</span>exit<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>but one <em>CANNOT</em> do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb43-1"><a href="#cb43-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>W<span class="op">=</span> fopen<span class="op">(</span>wc<span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">?</span> V<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">]</span> <span class="op">:</span> __FILE__<span class="op">,</span><span class="st">&quot;rt&quot;</span><span class="op">);</span><span class="cf">if</span><span class="op">(!</span>W<span class="op">)</span>exit<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">);</span></span>

<p>because <code>adwc.c</code> will be empty! The difference is it is on
a newline, the check. This is an example of how a simple change in code
can break it and this is also true of another change as further
below.</p>
<p>Cody also restored a slightly more obscure line of code that had been
changed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre
class="sourceCode diff"><code class="sourceCode diff"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="#cb44-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">-   putc(&quot;}|uutsrq`_^bji`[Zkediml[PO]a_M__]ISOYIRGTNR&quot;[i]+i-9,stderr);</span></span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="#cb44-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">+   putc(i[&quot;}|uutsrq`_^bji`[Zkediml[PO]a_M__]ISOYIRGTNR&quot;]+i-9,stderr);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>though it’s questionable how much more (if at all) obscure that is
:-)</p>
<p>Cody also changed the location that it used <code>gets()</code> to be
<code>fgets(3)</code>. This was complicated because of how the other
source files are generated (as above); simply changing the code could
cause invalid output in the program which made other files fail to
compile (for this example specifically, see below).</p>
<p>One might think that simply changing the <code>gets(3)</code> to
<code>fgets(3)</code> (with <code>stdin</code>) would work but it did
not because <code>fgets(3)</code> stores the newline and
<code>gets(3)</code> does not. That is well known but this code was
relying on not having this newline in a different way (see also
above).</p>
<p>With <code>fgets(3)</code> the code <code>if(A(Y)) puts(Y);</code>
ended up printing an extra line which made the generation of some files
(like <code>adhead.c</code>) fail to compile. Why? There was a blank
line after a <code>\</code> at the end of the first line of a <em>macro
definition</em>! Thus the code now first trims off the last character of
the buffer read to get the same correct functionality but in a safe and
non obnoxious way.</p>
<p>In this case the macro for <code>gets</code> could not be changed to
have the macro do the removal of the extra line (as in with a comma
operator or a <code>&amp;&amp;</code>) as this, as might be expected
from the above, caused compilation errors with another generated file
(<code>adwc.c</code>)! Thus after the <code>gets(3)</code> call in the
line that looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="#cb45-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">while</span><span class="op">(</span> gets<span class="op">(</span>Y<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">){</span> Y<span class="op">[</span>strlen<span class="op">(</span>Y<span class="op">)-</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">]=</span><span class="ch">&#39;</span><span class="sc">\0</span><span class="ch">&#39;</span><span class="op">;</span> <span class="cf">if</span><span class="op">(</span>A<span class="op">(</span>Y<span class="op">))</span> puts<span class="op">(</span>Y<span class="op">);</span> <span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>one must keep the <code>Y[strlen(Y)-1]='\0';</code> part and keep it
there.</p>
<p>These fixes are complex changes due to the way the program and
Makefile generate the additional tools.</p>
<p>Cody finally added the <a href="1992/adrian/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
that shows the entry and some of the tools this entry generates. Unlike
other scripts, it does not clear the screen after compilation so that
one can see how the other files are generated.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with modern systems.
Note that in 1996 a bug fix was applied to the code, provided as the alt
code as that version is not obfuscated. Thus Cody’s fix applies to the
original entry. The problems were that <code>malloc.h</code> is not the
correct header file now (at least in some systems?) and a non-void
(implicit <code>int</code>) function returning without a value. That
function was changed to return <code>void</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/albert/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="1992/albert/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> scripts that correspond to
the entry and the alt code.</p>

href="1992/ant/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the Makefile so that the program will
actually work with it (or at least the rule to clobber files and link
<code>am</code> to <code>ant</code>). The issue was that the variables
in the Makefile could not be evaluated in the same way as it’s not as
feature-rich as other implementations of <code>make(1)</code>. Thus the
use of <code>${RM}</code> and <code>${CP}</code> were in the respective
rules changed to <code>rm</code> and <code>cp</code>, for two examples.
A new rule had to be added as well. The variable situation might be
because they are obtained from the root variable Makefile
<code>var.mk</code> via <code>include</code> which the program might not
support (this has not been tested, however) and also because it appears
that the syntax for this program is to use <code>$()</code> rather than
<code>${}</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed another problem, unrelated, in the Makefile with the
<code>.PHONY</code> rule where a line was not ended with a
<code>\</code> but should have been.</p>
<p>The author stated that in some systems like DOS with Turbo C, it
might be necessary to include <code>time.h</code> so Cody did this as
well as this exists in other systems too.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/ant/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added a check for the right number of args,
exiting 1 if not enough (2) used. This was not originally done but at a
time it was changed to be considered a bug so it was fixed at that point
as it only took a few seconds and had to be verified that it was
consistent with the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file.</p>

<code>void</code>. This was fixed with a <code>,0</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/buzzard.2/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a crash that prevented this entry from
working in some cases in some systems (like macOS) by disabling the
optimiser in the Makefile.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/gson/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/gson/mkdict.sh">mkdict.sh</a>

its purpose. It was NOT fixed for <a
href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">ShellCheck</a> because the
author deliberately obfuscated it so <strong>PLEASE <em>DO NOT</em> FIX
THIS OR MODERNISE IT</strong>.</p>
<p>Cody also changed the buffer size in such a way that
<code>gets(3)</code> should be safe (well, theoretically) as it comes
from the command line (though it can also read input from
<code>stdin</code> after starting the program). Ideally
<code>fgets(3)</code> would be used but this is a more problematic. See
<a href="bugs.html#1992-gson">1992/gson in bugs.html</a> for more
details if you’re interested in trying to understand it (or fix?).</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> provided the <a
href="1992/imc/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<p>The original code, <a href="1992/imc/imc.orig.c">imc.orig.c</a>,
assumed that <code>exit(3)</code> returned a value but this will cause
problems where <code>exit(3)</code> returns void. The source code was
modified to avoid this problem but like Cody did with other fixes he
made this more like the original by redefining <code>exit</code> to use
the comma operator so that it could be used in binary expressions.</p>
<h2 id="kivinen-index.html"><a name="1992_kivinen"></a><a
href="1992/kivinen/kivinen.c">1992/kivinen</a> (<a
href="1992/kivinen/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p>It was observed that on modern systems this goes much too quick. <a
href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> created a patch that calls
<code>usleep(3)</code> but <a href="#cody">Cody</a> thought the value
was too slow so he made it a macro in the Makefile <code>Z</code> (which
can be redefined with <code>make SLEEP=...</code>), defaulting at 15000.
This was made an <a href="1992/kivinen/kivinen.alt.c">alt version</a>
and it is recommended one use the alt version first. See the index.html
file to see how to reconfigure it.</p>
<p>Cody also made the fixed version (the code relied on
<code>exit(3)</code> returning to use in binary expressions) (and alt
code from it) more like the original by renaming the <code>ext</code>
macro to be <code>exit</code> which uses the comma operator. He made it
so the line lengths match the original code, at least as best as
possible (if not perfectly), including start and end columns, often (if
not all) with the same start and end character.</p>
<p>Cody made <code>main()</code> have two args, not one, as some
versions of clang have a defect with the number of args to
<code>main()</code> though when it comes to 1 arg it is only in an error
message if say 4 args are used. This is out of an abundance of caution
as it’s quite possible that clang or the ANSI C committee end up further
changing this.</p>
<p>Yusuke also noted that there is a bug in the program where right
after starting it moves towards the right but if you click the mouse it
goes back.</p>

<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> supplied a patch which makes this work
with gcc. Due to how it works (see Judges’ remarks in the index.html

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> also provided the <a
href="1992/lush/lush.sh">lush.sh</a> script to demonstrate it as using
make was problematic.</p>
<p>Cody made it use <code>fgets()</code> instead of
<code>gets()</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: this entry cannot work with clang due to different compiler
messages (it will compile fine but it won’t work). See <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the original file back as it was
deemed that the export restrictions should no longer be a cause of
concern for this entry. Doing this did require a change to Cody’s <a
href="2020/ferguson2/index.html">2020/ferguson2</a> entry as it’s
referenced.</p>
<p>Cody cynically noted that if he goes quiet, for instance if he no
longer participates in the IOCCC, that it must be our fault! :-)</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1992/nathan/try.sh">try.sh</a> script

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed an infinite loop if one were to input
numbers &lt; <code>0</code> or &gt; <code>077</code>. The problem was
that it tried to use <code>scanf(3)</code> with the format specifier
<code>"%o %o"</code> in a loop, reading again if <code>scanf(3)</code>
did not return 2 (that was not a problem in that <code>scanf(2)</code>
will not return until the number of specifiers have been processed or
some error occurs) or a function it called returned non-zero.</p>
<p>Instead the fix involves the <code>scanf(3)</code> specifiers being
<code>"%4s %4s"</code> on two new char arrays (always cleared in the
beginning of the loop) and then using <code>strtol(3)</code> with a base
of <code>8</code> (as it’s octal), checking for
<code>&lt; 0 || &gt; 077</code> on both numbers (using
<code>"%o %o"</code> does not solve the problem).</p>
<h2 id="westley-index.html-5"><a name="1992_westley"></a><a
href="1992/westley/westley.c">1992/westley</a> (<a
href="1992/westley/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to work for clang by changing the
third and fourth arg of <code>main()</code> to be <code>char **</code>
inside <code>main()</code>; clang requires args 2 - 4 to be
<code>char **</code> and some versions do not even allow a fourth
arg.</p>
<p>He also added the alternate version that the author gave in the
remarks that is specifically for the USA rather than the world. This had
to be fixed for clang as well to make the args of <code>main()</code> be
the correct type and by moving the body of main() to another function,
<code>pain()</code>, which does the work since not all versions of clang
support four args to <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also removed the restriction that one has to have a terminal
that wraps at 80 columns so that as long as the terminal’s columns (try
<code>echo $COLUMNS</code>) is &gt;= 80 it should work. As most people
have wider terminals than back in 1992 this should help make it much
easier to use. Note that if the number of columns is &lt; 80 it will not
work right. The way this was done is that every 80 iterations in the
final loop it prints another newline. This fix has another bonus in that
resizing the terminal after running it should not mess up the display
either, unless of course it becomes too small.</p>
<p>Cody added the scripts <a
href="1992/westley/whereami.sh">whereami.sh</a> and <a
href="1992/westley/whereami.alt.sh">whereami.alt.sh</a> which correspond
to the entry and the alt code but first check that the number of columns
is at least 80 and if not it is an error.</p>
<p>Cody added the <a href="1992/westley/try.sh">try.sh</a> script that
shows the different cities that the author recommended one try as well
as the one recommended by the judges (approximate judging location),
labelling each city and printing a newline before the next city. The
try.sh script uses the <code>whereami.sh</code> and
<code>whereami.alt.sh</code> scripts, as long as they’re executable (if
they’re not it first tries to make it executable and if it fails to do
so it just uses <code>westley</code> or <code>westley.alt</code>. The
scripts can be deceived by <code>COLUMNS=80 ./try.sh</code> (or
<code>COLUMNS=80 ./whereami.sh</code> etc.) but this is a feature, not a
bug.</p>
<p>Cody also added an arg check because the program and the <a
href="1992/westley/westley.alt.c">alternate version</a> might have
crashed or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon">nuked</a> the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">entire world</a> or just the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">USA</a>,
respectively, without enough args (2). And not that we need the help or
anything for this :-) but we encourage you to try the original without
two args :-)</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added an <a

does what the program did with gcc &lt; 2.3.3. See the index.html file
for details and for why this was made the alternate version, not the
actual entry. This alternate version will compile automatically (as
<code>lmfjyh</code> itself) in the very likely case (if you don’t have
gcc &lt; 2.3.3) that the entry fails to compile.</p>
<p>Cody also made the Makefile delete the very unsafe filename that is
compiled (or would be compiled if gcc &lt; 2.3.3) whether or not
compilation succeeds (which is highly unlikely).</p>

happening with faster systems. This version also checks for two args and
it is the one we recommend one try first. See the index.html files for

help with terminal sanity after the program ends.</p>
<p>Cody provided two alternate versions to simplify slowing the game
down and, for the second one, to make movement keys (of the default
game) more familiar to vi users. The slowing down was based on our
suggestion that it might be desired to slow down but Cody did it in such
a way that makes it easy to configure at compile time. See the

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to work with clang. The problem
was that the third arg to main() was not a <code>char **</code>. Instead
<code>O5()</code> (which was <code>main()</code> via
<code>-DO5=main</code>) is now its own function which main() calls with
the right parameters.</p>
<p>Later Cody fixed it again to look much more like the original where
only a single line is added, that of <code>main()</code>, which calls
<code>O5()</code>. This was done through <code>-include stdio.h</code>
at the compiler (in the Makefile) and by removing the <code>O3</code>
variable (an int) at the top of the file, instead making it a
<code>char **</code> in <code>main()</code> (<code>O5()</code> had three
args) but then passing in <code>0</code> to <code>O5()</code> for the
third arg (as it was 0 at file scope already this is perfectly fine and
it means there’s no need to cast it to an int in the function call
though that would also work).</p>
<p>Cody also added the alt code, provided by the author, which is:</p>
<pre><code>... a version of the program before it got formatted into the VIII,
augmented with comments showing where each state begins. N1 and N2 are
notes.</code></pre>
<p>but fixed to work with clang as well.</p>
<p>NOTE: the <code>N1</code> and <code>N2</code> are provided as notes
in the index.html file describing this code. Other code is also
described there.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed an infinite loop that could happen
when you shoot an arrow and end up having no arrows, thus making one
force quit the game. The problem was in a condition in the outer loop it
would repeatedly get input (if <code>getchar()</code> returned
<code>'\n'</code>), only if one has more than one arrow, returning after
that. But if there were 0 arrows left it did not return and so the loop
started over, doing nothing. This fix also seems to have fixed a problem
where if you shoot your last arrow it would not move you to the room you
shoot into (whereas if you had more arrows it would).</p>
<p>Cody added an alt version that allows one to cheat by specifying how
many arrows to start with (this was for fun but it turned out a good way
to debug the above infinite loop too which hanged the program).</p>
<p>As in some places it would properly say that you have ‘1 arrow’ or
else, if you have any other number of arrows (including 0), it would say
‘arrows’, Cody fixed a place where it always said ‘arrows’. A minor fix
and not that important.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed the problem where one could only get the arrows back
from the robber if the robber stole as many arrows as you ever found
rather than that minus how many you have shot. In other words if you had
three arrows and shot one and found no more you could never get the
arrows back from the robber because you could never lose all three since
you spent one. This bug manifested itself in another way too: once you
got the arrows back the counter was not reset so you could only get the
arrows back once even if the robber stole more. Now the counters are
reset. The way this bug was fixed is that there is now a counter for how
many you have found and how many you shot in addition to the two that
already existed, how many you had and how many were stolen.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to check that four args were
specified. With the use of the C pre-processor macro and inclusion of
<code>stdlib.h</code> in the Makefile the layout of the source is
exactly the same column width and no additional lines were added. This
was done during one of the times where this was changed to bug to fix
status, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed the Makefile which was causing alt code to be
compiled when it shouldn’t be.</p>

<p>Cody also added inclusion of <code>unistd.h</code> for
<code>getpid(2)</code>. While strictly speaking this was not necessary
(in multiple systems) it can sometimes be a problem and as it was
noticed it was changed (the only case this was done except in the
entries that actually did not work because of missing or incorrect
prototypes).</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this so it would compile and work with
modern compilers. The problem was that <code>srand()</code> returns
<code>void</code> but it was used in a <code>||</code> expression. Thus
the comma operator was needed.</p>
<p>Cody also fixed it for clang under Linux which objected to
incompatible pointer type (because <code>time(2)</code> takes a
<code>time_t *</code> which in some systems is a <code>long *</code> but
what was being passed to it is an <code>int</code>).</p>
<p>Cody also changed the entry to use <code>fgets(3)</code> instead of
<code>gets(3)</code>. This one has a minor annoyance in that it now
prints a newline after the output but this seems like a worthy
compromise for preventing the interspersed output in macOS and at the
same time it’s safer and allows for parsing file with longer lines.
Fixing it it to not have the extra newline is more problematic than it’s
worth, in macOS another line of output would be shown without the change
anyway - unless <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> - and the difference is that
now it’s just a blank line rather than an annoying warning. A subtlety
about this fix: if a line is greater than 231 in length if the program
chooses that line it might print the first 231 characters or it might
print (up to) the next 231 characters and so on.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added two alt versions, <a
href="1994/schnitzi/schnitzi.alt.c">one which uses
<code>fgets()</code></a> but when fed its own source code cannot
generate code that compile and another <a
href="1994/schnitzi/schnitzi.alt2.c">one with a bigger buffer size</a>
which, when fed its own source code, will generate compilable code but
not with the same buffer size but rather the original buffer size. Cody
explains this in the at <a href="bugs.html#1994-schnitzi">1994/schnitzi
in bugs.html</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose for these versions it both demonstrate how the magic
works behind it and to help others, should they wish, get the code to
work with <code>fgets(3)</code>, with or without an increase in buffer
size. Note that without this feeding longer files, say the index.html
file, will crash the program. See <a
href="bugs.html#1994-schnitzi">1994/schnitzi in bugs.html</a> where Cody
also explains the magic for more details. Later on, if nobody takes up
the task, Cody might resume it, but for now there is more important work
to do so that the next contest can run.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a bug on systems where
<code>EOF != -1</code>. The problem is that <code>getc()</code> and the
related functions do not return <code>-1</code> on EOF or error but
rather <code>EOF</code>. However <code>EOF</code> is not required to be
<code>-1</code> but merely an int &lt; 0 and this program assumed that
<code>getc()</code> will return <code>-1</code> on EOF or error, not
<code>EOF</code>. On systems where <code>EOF != -1</code> it could
result in an infinite loop.</p>

scripts are <a href="1994/tvr/try.color.sh">try.color.sh</a>, <a

scripts go through each mode allowed with two sizes, 128 and 256,
allowing one to quit or skip each (given that there are a lot of
invocations this seemed like a good idea).</p>
<p>Cody also made this use <code>fgets(3)</code> instead of
<code>gets(3)</code>. In this case the newline had to be terminated but
it was a pretty straightforward fix. <code>gets()</code> was defined to
use <code>fgets()</code> and the inclusion of <code>stdio.h</code> had
to be added but to make it more like the original entry this was done in
the Makefile. The alt code was also changed to use
<code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>

<code>primes(1)</code> and <code>rev(1)</code> are installed it will
reverse the lines of the <code>weisberg</code>, feeding it to
<code>primes(1)</code>, showing those that are primes. It only does the
reversed output because the program actually prints primes.</p>

a thing anyway :-) ). See the index.html for details on this.</p>
<p>Out of an abundance of caution with clang, Cody also added a second
arg to <code>main()</code> as some versions of clang whine about the
number of args on top of the type of args. In particular some versions
supposedly only allow 0, 2 or 3 args. It actually appears to allow 1 but
if you specify 4 it says 0, 2 or 3 and it is an error but it’s entirely

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> provided an <a

<code>usleep()</code> in between writing the output to make it easier to
see what is going on with faster systems and importantly also for those
who are sensitive to text flashing by rapidly (it affects him too but he
also thinks it moves too fast nowadays anyway). We recommend that you
try the alternate version first due to these reasons.</p>

he just commented out as little as possible to get this to compile.</p>
<p>Cody also added the rather useful <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="1996/schweikh1/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<p>The author stated that <code>-I/usr/include</code> is needed by gcc
in Solaris because <code>errno.h</code> has two identical extern
declarations of <code>errno</code>. That leads to an error due to the
redefinition of <code>main</code> but the <code>-I</code> option makes
sure the working <code>/usr/include/rrno.h</code> is found first, which
shouldn’t cause any problems on other systems (the other file is
<code>gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5/2.7.2/include/errno.h</code>). Thus
Cody also added this to the Makefile despite the fact that very few
probably use Solaris nowadays.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

try along with a shorter version of something the author suggested one
try (it is suggested that one try the longer version too but it will run

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a segfault in this entry as well as it
displaying environmental variables. Although the scripts showed correct
output, it somewhat lessened the usability because they segfaulted and
showed (an) environmental variable, interspersed with the output of the
program. With the fix they no longer have this problem. If
<code>argc &lt; 5</code> (<code>argv[4]</code> is referenced) it will
not do anything and it will not segfault either - this was caused by the
body of the for() loop which is now empty (it doesn’t appear to be
needed at all at least modernly). Note that you should check the <a
href="1996/westley/westley.alt.c">westley.alt.c</a> file when reading
the author’s comments. To see how to use the original, see the
index.html file.</p>
<p>Cody also added the two scripts, <a
href="1996/westley/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="1996/westley/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> to automate showing the
different clocks, both with the fixed version and the original (alt)
version.</p>
<p>Also, to fix any potential problem with displaying in GitHub the
scripts provided by the author, Cody added ‘.sh’ to the
<code>clock[1-3].sh</code> scripts.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> improved the Makefile to allow for easier
redefining the control keys and time step that the author set up.</p>
<p>Cody also set up the Makefile to have an alt build (using the same
code) for those who do not have a page up or page down key and added the
<a href="1998/banks/keysym.h">keysym.h</a> header file as a reference
for other keys one can use if they wish to modify the controls. One can
certainly do this even if they do have page up and page down but this
gives a default for those who don’t have them like with Macs. The alt
build hard codes the page up and page down alternatives because not
doing so would overly complicate both builds and since you can configure
them all in both builds it shouldn’t matter.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a>, out of an abundance of caution, added a
second arg to <code>main()</code> as some versions of clang whine about
the number of args on top of what type they are In particular some
versions claim that they only allow 0, 2 or 3 args. It appears that they
do allow 1 but for instance 4 is not allowed. However as it’s quite
possible they will ‘fix’ this defect it would be better to have this not
be a problem at such a time.</p>

prevent any possible problems in some systems (which has happened).</p>
<p>Cody also made the fixed version to look more like the original
version by using the old style of <code>main()</code> args so that it
reads <code>i,love_unix</code> more naturally, and by changing the
<code>typedef int lint</code> to be <code>typedef int _int</code>. See
the code for why this has to be done this way.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1998/df/try.sh">try.sh</a> script which
runs the program in a loop until one hits <code>q</code> (or
<code>Q</code>) or sends intr/ctrl-c. He also proposed there’s a way to

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile. The problem was the
intermediate steps to get to the final code that is compiled. The code
is now what it essentially becomes when processed completely. The
intermediate steps can now be performed to see how it expands but it can
still compile and be used.</p>
<p>Cody also added a second arg to <code>main()</code> out of an
abundance of caution as some versions of clang whine about the number of
args to <code>main()</code>. These versions claim that only 0, 2 or 3
are allowed but it does allow 1 anyway. It is quite possible though that
this will change so it is fixed in case this happens. As it is mostly
just through the C pre-processor Cody added a new macro to make the code
look like the original with just an extra arg.</p>
<p>In some versions of clang <code>-Wno-int-conversion</code> had to be
added to the <code>CSILENCE</code> variable of the Makefile.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1998/fanf/try.sh">try.sh</a> script to

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed invalid data types which prevented
this entry from working, causing a segfault. This showed itself in two
parts which required two fixes, one for Linux and further changes for
macOS. He also fixed a segfault (after printing garbage) when the arg
specified evaluated to 0. It was decided by us, the judges, that these
segfault fixes should be made because the program is so beautiful.</p>
<p>Later on Cody improved the fixes by checking that the arg is a number
<code>&gt;0 &amp;&amp; &lt;27</code> as that was noted by the author as
a requirement and again since it’s such a beautiful program it is worth
it, especially as the larger the number the larger the resulting program
becomes. It can be gigabytes in length if it doesn’t crash. At this
point since the author stated it has no <code>while</code>,
<code>do...while</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>if/else</code>,
<code>switch</code>, <code>?:</code> Cody removed the if statement by
doing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb48-1"><a href="#cb48-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">((</span>V<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">]&amp;&amp;((</span>atoi<span class="op">(</span>V<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">])&gt;</span><span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">&amp;&amp;</span>atoi<span class="op">(</span>V<span class="op">[</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">])&lt;</span><span class="dv">27</span><span class="op">))||(</span>exit<span class="op">(</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">),</span><span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">)));</span></span></code></pre></div>

href="1998/schweikh1/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern systems (it did not
work at all) and added an alternate version that works with macOS. Cody
also made it ever so slightly more portable by removing the hard-coding
of <code>gcc</code>, instead hard-coding it <code>cc</code>. Doing this
not only lets it work with systems without <code>gcc</code> (though in
macOS it does exist but is actually <code>clang</code>) as
<code>cc</code> always should. Getting this entry to work was quite
complicated but is also very interesting.</p>
<p>To see how the macOS fixes works, see the <a
href="1998/schweikh1/macos.html">macos.html</a> file but do note that
this includes spoilers for both versions! The fixes to get it to work at
all are described next.</p>
<p>So what was wrong with the original?</p>
<p>The call to <code>freopen(3)</code> was incorrect with the second arg
(the mode) being <code>5+__FILE__</code>; it is now <code>"r"</code>.
(Observe that the mode to the <code>fopen(3)</code> call is:
<code>43+__FILE__</code>. This might seem incorrect and indeed it can be
changed to <code>"r"</code> as well but this was not actually necessary
so once this was noticed it was changed back to the original.)</p>
<p>Another important change is that the files are only closed if the
<code>FILE *H</code> is <code>!= NULL</code>. Without this check,
because it’s almost certain that some files will not exist, it would
dereference a NULL pointer and very likely crash or halt and catch fire
:-), preventing the entry from working. Notice how <code>H</code> is a
funny macro defined as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb49"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb49-1"><a href="#cb49-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">%:define H</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="pp">x</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="pp"> </span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="pp">st</span><span class="op">%:%:</span><span class="pp">x</span><span class="op">##.</span><span class="pp">h</span><span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and yet the <code>FILE *</code> can be called <code>H</code>! This
might or might not make sense to you but if it doesn’t can you figure
out why?</p>
<p>Another fix is that previously the program would
<code>return 1</code> if a file failed to open but for the same reason
as above, it being very likely some files will not exist, the return was
removed so that if the statement of the <code>if</code> is true the
<code>while</code> loop run, rather than having the loop by itself. It
was done this way to make it as close to the original as possible and to
maintain the obfuscation as close as possible as well.</p>
<p>Also crucial, and the final fixes to make it work, is that the arrays
<code>K</code> and <code>L</code> had to be increased in size. They were
originally (somewhat bewildering at first glance) defined as
<code>K[X(*)], L[X(&lt;&lt;)]</code> but they were changed to
<code>K[(X(*))*4], L[4*X(&lt;&lt;)]</code> though it is no longer clear
just how necessary this might be.</p>
<p>As noted, a limitation of <code>gcc</code> existing was removed by
Cody to make it so that <code>gcc</code> is not required as
<code>cc</code> should exist in every system with a C compiler and as
the author stated: as long as the options <code>-E -dM</code> of the
compiler prints out the macros in the form of <code>gcc -dM</code> i.e.,
the lines are in the form <code>#define MACRO value</code> it will work,
assuming that compiler can run, of course.</p>
<p>Cody also added the perl script that the author provided that they
used to compute the character count in the code according to the contest
rules of 1998 in the file <a
href="1998/schweikh1/charcount.pl">charcount.pl</a>.</p>
<h2 id="schweikh2-index.html-1"><a name="1998_schweikh2"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the code to not trigger an internal
compiler error in gcc:</p>
<pre><code>:10:16: warning: type defaults to &#39;int&#39; in declaration of &#39;zero&#39; [-Wimplicit-int]
: In function &#39;main&#39;:
:12:1: warning: missing terminating &quot; character
:12:19: internal compiler error: invalid built-in macro &quot;__FILE__&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The string <code>"01\015"</code> had to be changed to
<code>ONE(O(1,1,2,6,0,6))</code>. For an interesting historical
explanation and further details and fun, see the <a
href="1998/schweikh2/index.html#historical-remarks">historical
remarks</a> in the index.html.</p>
<p>Cody also added an <code>int</code> after <code>register</code> in
<code>main()</code> in case clang decides to have a problem with that in
the future which is not entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1998/schweikh2/try.sh">try.sh</a>
script.</p>
<h2 id="schweikh3-index.html-1"><a name="1998_schweikh3"></a><a
href="1998/schweikh3/schweikh3.c">1998/schweikh3</a> (<a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="1998/schweikh3/index.html#alternate-code">alternate code</a> which
allows one to reconfigure the size constant in the rare case that the
author wrote about occurs.</p>
<p>Cody made <code>main()</code> have two args out of an abundance of
caution as some versions of clang say that <code>main()</code> can only
have 0, 2 or 3 args. These versions accept 1 arg but it is entirely
possible that they fix this so this should prevent it from breaking if
that happens.</p>
<p>Cody added the <a href="1998/schweikh3/try.sh">try.sh</a> script to
make it easier to try the commands that we suggested. One command was
not added, that of the to use command.</p>
<p>Cody also made the Makefile rule <code>all</code> symlink the entry
to <code>samefile</code> as that is the name of the program.</p>
<p>The author stated that:</p>
<pre><code>In the remote event that the input has more than `8192` files with
the same size (on systems where `sizeof (char *) == 4`, or `4096` when
`sizeof (char *) == 8`), increase the manifest constant 32767 on line
31.</code></pre>
<p>so Cody changed the constant to a macro in the Makefile called
<code>SZ</code> so one can more easily do this (though it indeed seems
highly unlikely). See the index.html for more details.</p>
<p>There actually is a web page for the tool and this was added to the
author information for the entry. It has not been added to any JSON
file.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the assumption that <code>EOF</code>
is <code>-1</code> (the author noted that it assumes it is
<code>-1</code> and it’s indeed a valid concern as the standard only
guarantees that it’s a value <code>&lt; 0</code>) and that
<code>1</code> is a valid code to return failure (it seems unlikely that
it wouldn’t be but since the author suggested it it was changed to
<code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>). To make it so the lines end at the same
columns as the original the <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code> change was done by
redefining <code>exit(3)</code> to be
<code>exit(a) return EXIT_FAILURE</code> and <code>1</code> was passed
to it (<code>return</code> was used because the original program had
<code>return 1</code>).</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="1998/tomtorfs/try.sh">try.sh</a> script

<code>na</code>. He notes that this entry crashes under macOS but it

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this for modern compilers. Depending
on the compiler it would either segfault when run or not compile at all
(gcc and clang respectively).</p>
<p>Cody also provided alternate code that supports the southern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>Cody also provided the <a href="2000/natori/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="2000/natori/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> scripts that show the Moon
phase in artistic ways. It is recommended one try both a number of times
in a row on different days (that is run <code>./try.sh</code> several
times in a row a few days apart, until you see all the Moon phases, and
run <code>./try.alt.sh</code> a few times in a row a few days apart,
until you see all the Moon phases).</p>
<p>Later on Cody restored the <code>#include</code>s in the source code
which had been changed by us to make it a one-liner again but this was
an error as it was not a one-liner but rather a small program. At the
same point Cody made the code itself a one-line like the code is in the
original entry. Now it looks much more like the original entry but with
the two fixes.</p>
<p>Finally Cody fixed the Makefile that had the <code>-Wno-foo</code>
options in the <code>CDEFINE</code> variable which although works it is
incongruent with the other Makefiles and is more confusing (even if not
confusing).</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed an infinite loop that occurred if

<p>This was fixed by having the <code>scanf(3)</code> read in a string
and then use <code>atoi(3)</code> on it to assign to the
<code>int</code>s, much like with <code>1987/lievaart</code>. The
strings are <code>char[5]</code> and the <code>%</code> specifier is
<code>%4s</code> which is enough for the game.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the code and added an appropriate make
rule so that the <a href="https://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> version works
independent from the curses version (using the same code).</p>
<p>Cody also added alt code to allow one to slow down the code. This
code also, at least for the curses mode, allows one to quit at any time
by pressing ‘q’. See below for more details.</p>
<p>Due to a terrible design choice of the SDL1 developers something had
to be changed. As was noted in the log:</p>
<pre><code>The SDL version did not work for a number of reasons. First of all the
code requires that SDL is defined. Second the path[sic] wrong header file was
included. Third the SDL1 developers thought it would be a great idea
(but obviously it&#39;s a terrible idea) to redefine main() (!!) so that any
program that uses SDL1 has to have the same args as their definition.
This program had &#39;main()&#39; so the error message was:

    thadgavin.c:60:1: error: conflicting types for &#39;SDL_main&#39;
    main()
    ^
    /opt/local/include/SDL/SDL_main.h:34:14: note: expanded from macro &#39;main&#39;
    #define main SDL_main
         ^
    /opt/local/include/SDL/SDL_main.h:35:12: note: previous declaration is here
    extern int SDL_main(int argc, char *argv[]);
           ^
    1 warning and 1 error generated.
    make: *** [thadgavin_sdl] Error 1

Thus main() was changed to &#39;int main(int argc, char **argv)&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>Cody also added an alternate version to help see what is going on in
more modern systems and in case you’re sensitive to rapidly moving
swirling. See the index.html for details on that. Note that this
alternate version only will impact the curses and the SDL versions as
Cody does not have a DOS system to test the other version in.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

author’s remarks with a fix for modern systems and he also added the two
scripts, <a href="2000/tomx/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="2000/tomx/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> for the main code and the alt
code respectively.</p>
<p>And although the scripts do <code>chmod +x</code> on the source code
(see the index.html for details) the source code is now executable by
default.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed both the supplementary program and the
program itself (both of which segfaulted and once that was fixed only
the binary was modified; it was not run but according to the author’s
remarks it should be executed). He managed to do this with Linux but it
will not work with any system that does not allow one to compile 32-bit
ELF binaries. See <a
href="bugs.html#2001anonymous-readmemd">bugs.html</a> for why this is;
<em>this is <strong>not</strong> a bug, it’s a feature</em> inherent in
what it does!</p>
<p>The following had to be done to fix this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</code> for <code>mmap()</code> and
<code>munmap()</code>.</li>
<li>have <code>main()</code> call another function which is no longer a
recursive function; this prevented <code>main()</code> from entering an
infinite recursive loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without these it would crash and prevent modification of the 32-bit
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a>
(not elf :-) ) binary. But again see <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>
here.</p>
<p>These also had to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>when <code>open()</code>ing the file the file descriptor had to be
saved so it could be closed prior to executing the program. This is the
<code>f</code> variable which an <code>int</code>.</li>
<li><code>munmap()</code> also had to be called prior to executing the
program. This involved a new <code>off_t N</code> which was added in the
<code>mmap()</code> call which was then used in the
<code>munmap()</code> call.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without those changes the program was not executed after modification
which it was supposed to do; instead it reported text file busy
error.</p>
<p>Notice that the location of <code>munmap()</code> and
<code>close()</code> followed by <code>execv()</code> <em>does
matter</em>!</p>
<p>To get this to compile with clang, <code>main()</code> had to change
from:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb54-1"><a href="#cb54-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main <span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>ck<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">**</span>k<span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="#cb55-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>main <span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">int</span> cka<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">**</span>k<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span> <span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*</span>ck <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="dt">char</span> <span class="op">*)</span>cka<span class="op">;</span> <span class="co">/* ... */</span> <span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The following change was also made to be more portable, in case the
constants <code>PROT_READ</code> and/or <code>PROT_WRITE</code> are not
standardised or some platform does not follow it:</p>
<p>Change <code>3</code> in the call to <code>mmap()</code> to be
<code>PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE</code>: just in case
<code>PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE</code> does not equal 3 (though it seems to
be equal in both macOS and Linux).</p>
<p>NOTE: there might be educational value to see the progress of this
fix; if you wish to see, try the following commands from the
<code>2001/anonymous</code> directory:</p>

Bottles</a> but which sings <a
href="https://allnurseryrhymes.com/ten-in-the-bed/">Ten in the Bed</a>
instead.</p>
<p>As well he added the <a href="2001/anonymous/try.sh">try.sh</a> so
that one can attempt to use the program as it was designed but if
compiling as 32-bit fails it will at least run the supplementary program
as a 64-bit program directly.</p>
<h2 id="bellard-index.html"><a name="2001_bellard"></a><a
href="2001/bellard/bellard.c">2001/bellard</a> (<a
href="2001/bellard/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with clang but
according to the author this will not work without i386 Linux. It
generates i386 32-bit code (not bytecode) but unfortunately it will not
work without i386 Linux. See <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>.</p>
<p>Cody fixed an earlier segfault so that it can at least now open the
file should you have an i386 Linux machine (it can open it in other
platforms too, of course, but it won’t work). This involved pointer
updates and also changing an <code>int</code> to a <code>FILE *</code>.
Where possible he left the macros as the same but in the case of
<code>main()</code> this was not possible.</p>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> added another change (see below) to make
it even more portable across compilers besides what Cody did.</p>
<p>Cody entirely fixed the <a
href="2001/bellard/bellard.otccex.c">supplementary bellard.otccex.c</a>
so it does not segfault and works as well (it did not work at all). The
main problem was that some ints were being used as pointers. This
includes, for example, an int used as a <code>char *</code>, an int used
as a function pointer and an int to access <code>argv</code> as well as
there being invalid access to <code>argv</code>. He updated the Makefile
so that this program will compile by default.</p>
<p>Also the Fibonacci sequence (<code>fib()</code>) will overflow at
<code>n &gt; 48</code> so this is checked prior to running the function
just like the author did for the factorial (overflowing at
<code>&gt;12</code>). Either way unfortunately this entry seems to not
work in 64-bit Linux or macOS. See below portability notes as well as
another fix in this entry by Yusuke.</p>
<h2 id="portability-notes">Portability notes:</h2>
<p>With a tip from Yusuke we rediscovered the author’s <a
href="https://bellard.org/otcc/">web page for this program</a> where it
is stated that this will only work in i386 Linux. The author also stated
in the remarks in this document that they used <a
href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.95.2/gcc-everything-2.95.2.tar.gz">gcc
2.95.2</a> but we don’t know if that’s relevant or not.</p>
<p>Yusuke offered a modification which is not needed with gcc but with
some versions of <code>clang</code> it is. With <code>gcc</code> we can
get away with <code>-rdynamic -fno-pie -Wl,-z,execstack</code> which
solves the problem of execution in memory but any compiler that does not
support this would not work. Thus we use the modification by Yusuke.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to work with clang by adding
another function that is allowed to have a third arg as an int, not a
<code>char **</code>. He chose <code>pain()</code> because it’s a four
letter word that would match the format and because it’s pain that clang
forces this. :-) This fix makes a point of the author’s notes on
portability no longer valid, BTW.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2001/cheong/try.sh">try.sh</a>

<p>and for some reason it was being reported as an error. This was not
really worth a thanks per se but it was originally done by adding

what was done later on to make it more like the original.</p>

which might be more useful than any other place as the command to try is
quite long with C code.</p>
<p>For some reason the original code was missing (presumingly because it
had been added to <code>.gitignore</code> by accident) but Cody restored
it from the archive.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> improved the Makefile to allow one to more
easily set up the port, speed and <code>socket(2)</code> call that the
author had set up.</p>
<p>Cody also slowed down the ball just a tad (it was already a
<code>-D</code> macro that was used in the code) as it went too fast for
the speed at which the paddles move even when holding down the movement
keys (but see below).</p>
<p>Cody also provided an <a href="2001/kev/kev.alt.c">alternate
version</a> which lets you use the arrow keys on your keyboard instead
of the more awkward ‘<code>,</code>’ and ‘<code>.</code>’.</p>
<p>He updated both versions to have <code>#ifndef..#endif</code> pairs
for the macros so one can more easily configure different settings
without having to specify all of them (though this change became
unnecessary with an improvement on how it was done). The speed,
<code>SPEED</code>, will be set to 50 if it’s not defined at the
compiler line as 50 is what it used to be set to. This way it’s more to
the original but without having to sacrifice playability by running
<code>make</code>.</p>

which allows those like himself used to <code>h</code>, <code>j</code>,
<code>k</code> and <code>l</code> movement keys to not get lost. Non
rogue players, vi users and Dvorak typists are invited to get lost (or
use the original version)! :-)</p>
<p>Cody also renamed the <code>arachnid.info</code> file to <a
href="2004/arachnid/arachnid.txt">arachnid.txt</a> as it’s not really an
informative file but a maze file. The extension <code>.maz</code> was
not chosen to help with (some?) browsers knowing what to do with it.</p>

href="2004/burley/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with clang and also
fixed it to work.</p>
<p>For clang the problem was that <code>main()</code> had one arg, a
<code>char *</code> and this is not allowed in any version of clang. In
some versions it is allowed if the arg is an <code>int</code> but never
if it’s anything else. To get it to work took numerous changes.</p>
<p>First the inclusion of <code>setjmp.h</code> was necessary. Without
this <code>longjmp(3)</code> implicitly returned <code>int</code> which
was used for the purpose of binary expression but this no longer
worked.</p>
<p>But by including <code>setjmp.h</code> it naturally made the binary
expressions invalid (as it returns <code>void</code> which is not
allowed in binary expressions) so the comma operator with <code>0</code>
(<code>,0</code>) had to be used (<code>,1</code> was tried first but
this did not work right).</p>
<p><code>longjmp(3)</code> was being called with one arg which was an
element of an <code>int[4][1000]</code> which had to be changed to a
<code>jmp_buf p[4]</code> (this due to the prototype being
included).</p>
<p><code>main()</code> also called itself but this was a problem so it
now calls another function <code>poke()</code> which calls itself
instead (this is sometimes necessary nowadays).</p>
<p>Finally the optimiser cannot be enabled so the compiler flags were
changed for this.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added three different <a

<ul>
<li><a href="2004/gavare/gavare.alt.c">gavare.alt.c</a> allows you to
change the image size and anti-alias setting at compile time.</li>
<li><a href="2004/gavare/gavare.alt2.c">gavare.alt2.c</a> is like <a
href="2004/gavare/gavare.alt.c">gavare.alt.c</a> but it should work for
Windows as well (it sets binary mode on <code>stdout</code>).</li>
<li><a href="2004/gavare/gavare.r3.c">gavare.r3.c</a> is the author’s
unobfuscated version that was used during development, found on their <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> provided the <a
href="2004/gavin/index.html#alternate-code">alt code</a> for those who
want to use QEMU. The most important part of this is the macro
<code>K</code> has to be defined as <code>1</code>, not
<code>0</code>.</p>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> provided the <code>kernel</code> and
<code>fs.tar</code> files which can be used if you cannot normally use
this entry. Instead of generating the files just use the files provided,
found under the <a href="2004/gavin/img/">img/</a> directory. Note that
the <code>img/fs.tar</code> extracts into <code>fs/</code> so you will
have to fix the tarball; this is done this way to prevent extraction
from the entry directory overwriting the files and causing
<code>make clobber</code> to wipe some of them out.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a bunch of links in the index.html
provided with the entry (web server) that no longer exist or have
changed in some other way (<code>https</code> instead of
<code>http</code> for instance). In most cases a new link or change to

<p>and various other problems.</p>
<p>Cody also added <a href="2004/jdalbec/index.html#alternate-code">alt

<code>:</code> to print before printing a newline, so that one can see
the output a bit better (though for lines that have a lot of numbers
this will be harder to see).</p>

<p>Cody, out of an abundance of caution for clang, added a second arg to

and although they accept 1 it is entirely possible it will eventually be
that they don’t.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2004/kopczynski/try.sh">try.sh</a>
script and various data files: <a href="kopczynski-a">kopczynski-a</a>
to demonstrate what happens when art more like a letter is fed to the

files reversed with <code>rev(1)</code>. One had to be modified
additionally to get it to work, that being
<code>kopczynski-10-rev</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the fix required heavy modification to the original
file (see below) and also inclusion of what used to be generated by the
<a href="2004/vik2/Makefile">Makefile</a> but now it at least works for
both Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>As for the fix itself it required changing the C pre-processor macros
that resulted in macros themselves like <code>#ifdef</code>,
<code>#else</code> etc. to be <code>#ifdef</code>, <code>#else</code>
etc. and also the inclusion of the file <a
href="2004/vik2/vik2_1.c">vik2_1.c</a> (which actually includes itself,
once directly and now by <code>__FILE__</code>) which used to be
generated by the Makefile via <code>cc -E</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also made it so that the <code>FNAME</code> is (for the entry
file itself and <code>vik2_1.c</code>: it shouldn’t be done for <a
href="2004/vik2/vik2.possible.cat.death.c">vik2.possible.cat.death.c</a>!)
<code>__FILE__</code> just to make it a bit easier to compile.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the test script, described by the

hardcoded). This had never been done and so the script did not even work

<p>He also added the <a href="2005/aidan/index.html#alternate-code">alt

<p>The author noted that one can define <code>NO_STTY</code> to not use

<p>After Landon fixed the entry to compile with clang <a
href="#cody">Cody</a> noticed this does not work at all in modern
systems (see below). He fixed this to work and then he later fixed the
self-test feature.</p>
<p>The problem that was showing up is that with either optimising or if
anything but 32-bit (as in <code>-m32</code>) was used it would not work
(at least in 64-bit systems?). The optimising cannot be used still but
it now works with both 32-bit and 64-bit. The solution has to do with
the size difference between <code>int</code> and <code>long</code> so
that the <code>long*E</code> is now <code>int*E</code>. This solves a
specific problem for Linux (32-bit, 64-bit) and macOS (arm64).</p>
<p>To get the self-test feature to work it was required to remove from
the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb63"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb63-1"><a href="#cb63-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>O<span class="op">-</span>b<span class="op">-</span>f<span class="op">-</span>u <span class="op">-</span>s<span class="op">-</span>c<span class="op">-</span>a<span class="op">-</span>t<span class="op">-</span>e<span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>as it caused a compilation error in some of the generated code but
served no purpose, didn’t affect the output of the puzzle and since the
‘string’ is already in the code there is no problem omitting it.</p>
<p>The most complicated fix was for, as might be expected,
<code>clang</code>: it (at least some systems?) has <code>-Werror</code>
by default so the program was changed to use <code>make</code> and then
<code>rm -f</code> on the output of the compiled binary instead. This
change might also not have been necessary if using different flags to
<code>cc</code> but this is less portable and caused other problems.
This was a complicated fix as it’s in the comments but in a funny way;
the final result to get the test feature to work is:</p>

<p>Cody also added the <a href="2005/giljade/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
which also lets one see the beauty of the entry without having to use
vi(m), should they be afraid of getting stuck in it (and for ease of
use). :-)</p>
<p>Finally, to improve upon the test-suite provided by the program, Cody
added the <code>make test</code> rule which only shows lines matching
<code>'^Line'</code> but writing to a temporary file the compilation
including the ‘Line’ lines. After that is done it uses
<code>grep -c</code> on the file to show that there are indeed as many
versions the program generates as the author states, 180. If it does not
find 180 it is an error; otherwise it is success. It uses <a
href="2005/giljade/test.sh">test.sh</a>.</p>

<p>The problem was that in the string above there was a
<code>\Newline</code> but this is invalid C. This was changed to be
<code>\nNewline</code> and then, because the code is supposed to output
itself when fed itself, the reference to <code>'N'</code> had to be
updated in both the string and the code to be <code>'n'</code>.</p>
<p>The array size of <code>c</code> was updated by 1 out of caution just
in case as the array is used to store at least part of the string.</p>
<p>It might be worth noting that the author stated that the reason for
the <code>\N</code> is due to LISP having different escape sequences.
The code was modified so that feeding the program itself will print
itself, showing no difference, which is what is supposed to happen. It
is not known, however, if having to change the <code>\N</code> to
<code>\n</code> ended up breaking any LISP. The other examples given by
the author also show correct output though.</p>

maybe, based on how https is set up, in which case just enjoy it for
what it was. But there might be some command line that will let it work
that way or perhaps someone wants to add the necessary code.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this in the case that the program is
compiled or linked/copies to another file name: the code constructed the
source code file name in a clever and more obscure way by copying to the
buffer <code>*argv</code> and then using <code>strcat(3)</code> to
concatenate to it <code>.c</code>. But this assumes that the executable
is the same name as the source file which isn’t always be true. The
author even stated: ‘as long as the source is in the same directory as
the executable it should be able to find it’ but the source code file
name is not always the same as the executable with the appropriate
extension so this might be called a bug fix as well though if one runs
it from another directory, specifying the directory, it’ll not catch
it.</p>

from <a href="https://www.libsdl.org">SDL2</a>, thus making it not link.
Since SDL2 is still available and since changing the code to use SDL2 is
much more complicated and also makes the entry less like the original it
was simply made to link in SDL1.</p>
<p>Nevertheless this entry does require x86/x86_64 CPUS. This is a
documented feature but one which we will accept fixes to. See <a

<p>As <a href="#cody">Cody</a> is a lost :-) <code>vim</code> user he

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this entry to work with clang which
has a defect with the args to <code>main()</code>: it requires specific
types: <code>int</code> and <code>char **</code> for the first and
latter args.</p>
<p>Cody also provided the <a href="2006/sloane/sloane.alt.c">alternate
version</a>, which allows one to see what is going on in modern systems,
and which we recommend one use <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>Curiously, although clang requires the types of args to be strictly
correct, some versions do allow only one arg. This was done at first
because it’s not used but Cody discovered that later versions of clang
have an additional defect where it does not allow only one arg so the
second arg to <code>main()</code> was added back.</p>
<p>This was an unfortunate problem for the alt code as he has been using
Z for alt code <code>usleep()</code> (for sleep) but in this case
unfortunately the original entry used <code>Z</code> in
<code>main()</code> (though unused) so to make it more like the original
Cody renamed the macro <code>Z</code> for <code>usleep()</code> to
<code>S</code> instead which can stand for sleep and also it is kind of
like a backwards <code>Z</code>. That way <code>Z</code> could be in
<code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also made sure that the Makefile links in <code>libm</code> as
not all systems do this by default.</p>
<p>Since the author suggested that the lack of certain
<code>#include</code>s might break the program in some systems he also
added <code>-include ...</code> to the Makefile as well.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed a segfault in this program which was
making it fail to work under macOS - it did not seem to be a problem
under Linux, at least not fedora. The problem was wrong variable types -
implicit <code>int</code>s instead of <code>FILE *</code>s. It now works
with both macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>Cody also added the (untested) alt code that is based on the author’s
remarks to port this to systems that have the non-standard
<code>kbhit()</code> and <code>getch()</code> (not the one from curses)
which is typically (always?) in <code>conio.h</code>.</p>
<p>The author, <a href="authors.html#Oscar_Toledo">Oscar Toledo G.</a>,
later went back over the program and modified the
<code>fread(3)</code>/<code>fwrite(3)</code> section to use the variable
<code>FILE *e</code> (that Cody changed) instead of <code>int y</code>,
making it to work on x86_64 (perhaps Cody’s fix was for arm64 only?).
Also, he added a note to clarify from where appears the
<code>IMPORT.COM</code> and <code>HALT.COM</code> files.</p>

entry so that it now works in modern (64-bit) systems. The crash appears
to only occur in macOS but the fix lets it work in both Linux and macOS.
The problem was that it relied on 32-bits so some <code>int</code>s were
changed to <code>long</code>s. The display problem might or might not
have been a problem in Linux with the old <code>int</code>s but this is
no longer known.</p>

<p>Cody also added two <a

one control how fast the fluid moves (how long to sleep in between
writes) and also the gravity factor, the pressure factor and the
viscosity factor as well as an alarm that lets one run it in a loop
without having to hit ctrl-c/intr in between (the alarm can be disabled,
however). The Makefile allows one to easily do this with variable names
rather than redefining <code>CDEFINE</code>.</p>
<p>The two different alt versions is because there are two versions: the
original and the colour version added by the author, <a

gravity factor to <code>I</code> and another with the default, and which
is run on the source file and each of the text files supplied by the

hit ctrl-c/intr in between .. say to make it more fluid :-)</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added alt code that fixes a problem where in
German ‘v’ sounds like ‘f’ which the program has as ‘f’: with the
original version it would translate ‘fier’ to ‘4’ when the word is
‘vier’. But see below.</p>
<p>Originally this was updated in the original code but it was noticed
that this caused <em>other</em> German (and maybe other languages?)
words to be incorrect so it was set as an alt version since the code was
already there. It might also be considered a feature and not a bug so an
alt version is the better way to go about it. Using both, however,
allows one to experience different capabilities and also enjoy or
appreciate the entry even more, given how simple the difference is.</p>
<p>Cody also added six scripts: <a href="2012/kang/en.sh">en.sh</a>, <a
href="2012/kang/de.sh">de.sh</a>, <a
href="2012/kang/en.alt.sh">en.alt.sh</a> and <a
href="2012/de.alt.sh">de.alt.sh</a> which count from 0 through 13 in
English and German using the original entry and the alt version
respectively.</p>
<p>In the German scripts it uses the umlaut and also does it without the
umlaut (add an ‘e’). Notice how the program picks up on this! All
scripts can use either version but the <code>.alt.sh</code> versions
default to the <code>alt</code> version whereas the other defaults to
the submitted entry. See the index.html for details.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth scripts, <a href="2012/kang/try.sh">try.sh</a>
and <a href="2012/kang/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a>, run a sequence of
commands to show different languages and numbers with the submitted and
alternate version respectively. Notice how a single letter changes so
much!</p>

second alternate version is like the first except that it also sets
binary mode on <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> which should
theoretically make it work in Windows.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2012/omoikane/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a

<p>Based on the author’s description it should be able to get this entry

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> <a href="2012/zeitak/test.sh">test.sh</a>
script and the <code>make test</code> rule that uses the script along
with a number of files that will correctly be flagged as incorrect
(including a text file and a java file, with a joke, to show that it’s
not that it parses C but rather just matching pairs though that’s
probably obvious) and some correctly nested files were also added
including <a href="1984/anonymous/index.html">1984/anonymous</a> (as the
author explicitly mentioned it) and a java file as well with another
joke.</p>
<p>A minor point is that the author noted that one should look at the
program source with tab space of 4 characters so Cody added the command
to do this in vim for those who use it, in the judges’ remarks, to make
it easier for those who do not know how, and to make it more obvious to
try it.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> changed the <code>return 0;</code> at the
end of the program to be <code>return system("reset");</code> (via
redefining <code>exit(3)</code> so that the column ending would be the
same) so that as long as it runs to completion the terminal will be sane
and the cursor will be visible. Using <code>atexit(3)</code> will not
work if the program is killed, signals are ugly and these would be
messing with the entry too much so these were not done.</p>
<p>Cody also added the alt version that lets one control how fast the
painting is done, based on the author’s recommendations, except that
Cody made it configurable at compile time. The Makefile was modified in
such a way as to make it very easy to redefine it at compile time.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2013/birken/try.sh">try.sh</a> script

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with modern systems.
The problems were that <code>localtime()</code> is used differently and
<code>time.h</code> being included (with <a
href="https://www.libsdl.org">SDL2</a> in macOS - but see below) there
was a conflicting function type. This appeared to be a problem with
macOS and only when SDL2 was included (but which as noted next it cannot
be).</p>
<p>The other problem is that this entry uses SDL functions that were
removed from SDL2 so the Makefile has to use <code>sdl-config</code> and
not <code>sdl2-config</code>. This meant that at one point to be
strictly technical, the removal of <code>localtime()</code> wasn’t
necessary but this change was left in place anyway.</p>
<p>Later on in an updated macOS (problem discovered in macOS Sonoma) the
entry failed to compile again also due to <code>localtime()</code> so he
removed the prototype entirely to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Cody also slightly improved the <code>runme</code> script (renamed to
<a href="2013/cable3/cable3.sh">cable3.sh</a> for consistency with other
entries that have wrapper scripts) to not assume that the program has
been compiled by running <code>make clobber all || exit 1</code> and he
also made it pass <code>shellcheck</code> (using <code>[[ .. ]]</code>
over <code>[ .. ]</code>).</p>
<p>As well, based on the author’s remarks, Cody added the <a
href="2013/cable3/cable3.alt.c">alternate code</a> which should be
compilable for Windows/MS Visual Studio. This is done by in the compile
line undefining <code>KB</code> (<code>-UKB</code>) and then in the
source code defining <code>KB</code> to what the author suggested,
<code>(kb=H(8),kbhit())&amp;&amp;(r[1190]=getch(),H(7))</code>. It need
hardly be mentioned that this will not link in Unix systems (including
macOS).</p>
<p>Clang required a <code>-Wno-</code> option as well.</p>
<p>Finally Cody provided the <a href="2013/cable3/bios.asm">bios.asm</a>
that the author referred to, found at the <a
href="https://github.com/adriancable/8086tiny/tree/master">GitHub repo
for the entry</a>, and the ‘ready-made 40MB hard disk image containing a
whole bunch of software’ in <code>hd.img</code> that the author linked
to at <code>https://bitly.com/1bU8URK</code>.</p>
<h2 id="dlowe-index.html-3"><a name="2013_dlowe"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the source code that we suggested one
should compile and run with different compilers as <a
href="2013/dlowe/fun.c">fun.c</a>. He modified the Makefile so that
running <code>make all</code> will compile it, saving you the
effort.</p>
<p>He also provided the script <a
href="2013/dlowe/slflen.sh">slflen.sh</a> which is based on the author’s
remarks, fixing it for shellcheck and improving upon it (show what files
will be processed). This script shows the sparkline of the file lengths
(as in <code>wc -c</code>). The fixes (but not the improvements) were
added to the author’s remarks.</p>
<p>Since the author called the program <code>sparkl</code> Cody modified
the Makefile so that running <code>make all</code> will create a symlink
to <code>dlowe</code> as <code>sparkl</code>. Running
<code>make clobber</code> will delete both and running
<code>make clobber all</code> will ensure that the symlink is created.
The <code>slflen.sh</code> script also explicitly makes sure to create
the symlink as it uses it, even though it runs
<code>make clobber all</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2013/dlowe/try.sh">try.sh</a> script to
more easily try the program.</p>
<p>He also added the <a href="2013/dlowe/diff.sh">diff.sh</a> script
which is based on some commands to try that he suggested to see how
different lengths look.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the Makefile <code>check</code> rule
so that it <code>checks</code> :-) that both <a
href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a
href="https://imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> are installed before
trying to run the ruby script. To be more technically correct: it checks
that the <code>convert</code> tool of ImageMagick is available (via
<code>type -P</code>) because <code>convert</code> is part of the
ImageMagick suite.</p>
<p>This is useful because the Ruby script tries to run (via
<code>IO.popen()</code>) the <code>convert</code> tool but without
ImageMagick being installed, if one is unaware of where it comes from it
will appear to be an error in the Ruby script (it might also appear to
be an issue with the script even if you know of <code>convert</code>: it
was another day that Cody remembered it and why it wasn’t installed on
his MacBook Pro even though in the past it had been and is indeed
now).</p>
<p>The rule will report the tools not installed and where to find them,
if they are not installed, and after checking these requirements it will
exit if either is not found.</p>
<p>The entry can still be enjoyed if you do not have these tools,
however.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="2013/endoh4/endoh4.sh">endoh4.sh</a> script which temporarily
turns off the cursor as suggested by the author, with the addition that
if no file is specified it will feed the source code <a
href="2013/endoh4/endoh4.c">endoh4.c</a> to the program rather than the
file specified. It does not try and detect if the file exists or can be
read as that will be handled by the shell/program. One may pass more
than one file to the script.</p>
<p>Cody also made it easier to redefine the size at compilation time
(see the author’s remarks for more details on what this means). The
<code>endoh4.sh</code> script allows one to redefine it as well.</p>
<h2 id="hou-index.html-2"><a name="2013_hou"></a><a

href="2013/hou/index.html">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the Makefile so that this would work
properly. Before this the use of the program just did what the judges’
remarks said as far as how it might violate rule 2: the program is
really just a decompressor to generate the real source of the program.
So the source of the entry has to be compiled and then run, and the
output has to be compiled to be <code>hou</code>. This allows the real
program to be used. Thus the Makefile rule looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre
class="sourceCode makefile"><code class="sourceCode makefile"><span id="cb70-1"><a href="#cb70-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">${PROG}:</span><span class="dt"> </span><span class="ch">${</span><span class="dt">PROG</span><span class="ch">}</span><span class="dt">.c</span></span>

<p>which then compiles like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="#cb71-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">cc</span> <span class="at">-std</span><span class="op">=</span>gnu11 <span class="at">-Wall</span> <span class="at">-Wextra</span> <span class="at">-pedantic</span> <span class="at">-Wno-sign-compare</span> <span class="at">-Wno-strict-prototypes</span>    <span class="at">-O3</span> hou.c <span class="at">-o</span> hou <span class="at">-lm</span></span>

<p>The <code>LDFLAGS</code> were updated to have <code>-lm</code> as the
author suggested it uses the <code>math.h</code> library which not all
systems link in by default (Linux for instance does not).</p>
<p>Further, after the file <code>2013/hou/doc/example.markdown</code>
was moved to <a
href="2013/hou/doc/example.html">2013/hou/doc/example.html</a> to match
the rest of the repo this broke <code>make</code> which Cody also
fixed.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2013/hou/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>

([index.html)[2013/mills/index.html))</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this so that the server would not
refuse the connection after the first call to <code>close(2)</code>. The
problem was that because the backlog to <code>listen(2)</code> was 1
once the connection closed the server was essentially ‘dead’. The
backlog was changed to 10 and this solves the problem. It is not known
if this was specific to macOS but it was not specific to a browser as
Safari and Firefox both had the problem.</p>

lets one redefine the port to bind to in case there is a firewall issue
or there is some other reason to not have the default port. Remember
that ports &lt; 1024 are privileged. It also lets you redefine the
timing constant <code>STARDATE</code> (see the author’s remarks for more
details on this macro). The Makefile was made to use variables so it’s
easier to redefine the port and timing constant.</p>
<h2 id="deak-index.html"><a name="2014_deak"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added <a

modified version of the entry it is the version the author provided
which would be what the program would look like if, as the author put
it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The usage of recognizable elements from the C programming language in
the application source code is intentionally kept to a bare minimum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. was not true.</p>
<p>This alt version did not originally compile because a value was left
off the <code>return</code> statement (this might have been fixed in the
index.html file too) so that was fixed and it also has
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> for <code>putchar(3)</code>. The
<code>#ifndef..#define..#endif</code> was not part of the original alt
code, of course.</p>

rule that runs the script. This script will check that <code>rake</code>
is installed and if it is not it will report this and then check that
<code>gem</code> is installed. It checks that <code>gem</code> is
installed in this case because <code>gem</code> is how you install
<code>rake</code>. If <code>gem</code> is not installed it tells you to
get it along with how to install <code>gem</code>. Then it tells you how
to install <code>rake</code>. If <code>rake</code> fails to run then it
tells you to install a specific gem and then to try again. Finally if
<code>rake</code> succeeds it will verify that <code>prog</code> is
executable and if it is it will run it.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2014/endoh1/try.sh">try.sh</a>

<p><strong><em>Barely</em></strong> worth noting but done nonetheless,
Cody renamed the <code>read_me.html</code> file to <a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the Makefile to compile this entry in
modern systems. The problem was that the <code>CDEFINE</code> variable
in the Makefile was missing <code>'</code>s: the <code>#define CC</code>
is an actual string that is, in the Makefile,
<code>"${CC} -fPIC"</code>, which translates to whatever the compiler is
followed by a space followed by <code>-fPIC</code> but without the
<code>'</code>s it was incomplete and so would not compile. Cody didn’t
have a chance to really look at the compiler error.</p>
<p><a href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> suggested that one should use
<code>-ldl</code> in the Makefile. This was not originally done because
it seemed to work but since it uses <code>dlsym()</code> it was added
later to make it more portable.</p>
<p>The program creates files in the working directory as part of how it
works (see the index.html file for details) so Cody made sure that
<code>make clobber</code> (via <code>make clean</code>) removes those
files and so that they are ignored by <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>

href="2014/vik/try.sh">try.sh</a> script. Cody notes that there is a bug
that will show itself as one of the features does not work right. The
translation of the raw audio to text is buggy in some cases.</p>
<p>Cody also added an alternate version that is based on the author’s
remarks that will theoretically work for Microsoft Windows compilers (if
anything works in Windows :-) ). We have no way of testing this and if
anything has changed since 2014 that would break it we do not know.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="2014/wiedijk/try.sh">try.sh</a> script which is based on the
command to try in the ‘try’ section but improved so one can more easily
specify what ident tool they want to use and also change which sed to
use, should they want to. It also checks that both of these two tools
exist and are executable and it pipes it through less as it’s longer
than a page worth of output.</p>

href="2015/burton/index.html%5D">index.html</a>)</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the code so one can make use of the
echo feature, where the first character of the filename starts with
<code>e</code>. The only way it would work before that is if one did
something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb72"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb72-1"><a href="#cb72-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ln</span> <span class="at">-sf</span> prog eprog</span>
<span id="cb72-2"><a href="#cb72-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">PATH</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="va">$PATH</span>:. <span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">eprog</span> <span class="st">&#39;...&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>since otherwise the first character would not be <code>e</code> but
rather a dot (<code>./eprog</code>). This was done by adding to the
Makefile <code>-include libgen.h</code> and adding to
<code>main()</code> after the variable declaration (<code>V*A;</code>)
the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb73"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb73-1"><a href="#cb73-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">*</span>K<span class="op">=</span>basename<span class="op">(*</span>K<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This was done for both the <a href="2015/burton/prog.c">prog.c</a>
and <a href="2015/burton/prog.alt.c">prog.alt.c</a>. The Makefile was
also updated to build <code>eprog</code> and <code>eprog.alt</code> to
make use of the feature more easily. Each is a new target (first in
<code>TARGET</code> and second in <code>ALT_TARGET</code>) which have a
prerequisite of <code>${PROG}</code> and <code>${PROG}.alt</code>
respectively both of which also copy the <code>prog</code>
(<code>prog</code> or <code>eprog</code>) to the respective
<code>eprog</code> (<code>eprog</code> or <code>eprog.alt</code>). With
these changes now one can easily use the echo feature the author
implemented.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2015/burton/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.
This involved adding a text file, <a
href="2015/burton/try.this.txt">try.this.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Cody also added <a href="2015/burton/calc.1">calc.1</a> in place of
<code>calc.man</code> to have proper formatting (in the style of
<code>man(1)</code>). The <code>calc.man</code> was removed so as to not
have to maintain two copies of the same text.</p>
<p>Cody updated the Makefile to copy the <code>prog</code> to
<code>calc</code> and <code>prog.alt</code> to <code>calc.alt</code>.
<code>ecalc</code> and <code>ecalc.alt</code> also work. This is because
the program is called <code>calc</code> and is in documentation
including the man page. Thus one only need add a <code>./</code> to the
commands in the man page/index.html.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> improved the Makefile so that one can easily
change the dimensions at compilation time via <code>make(1)</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also added alt code that is based on the author’s remarks,
suggesting that one change the value of <code>q</code> to a different
number, in order to see a bug that they avoided.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed this to compile with Linux which was
having a problem with duplicate symbols of <code>main()</code>. The fix
is through the compiler option <code>-fcommon</code> which will let it
compile like it does with macOS.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2015/endoh3/try.sh">try.sh</a> script
which makes use of the make rule he added (to enjoy the theme of the
entry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future">Back
to the Future</a> using this entry by simply typing
<code>make back_to</code> or <code>make mullender</code>) and then runs

<p>Cody also added the <a href="2015/hou/try.sh">try.sh</a> script and
the large file <code>large</code> which the <code>try.sh</code> script
uses.</p>
<p>Cody also added the RFC 1321 text file, <a

to what we had in the judges’ remarks to make it easier (he only died
when he tried to mark a reminder complete on the other side of the

will be <code>-1</code> as the program assumes this. It was decided by
Cody to do <code>-UEOF -DEOF=-1</code> so as to not have to modify the

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

<p>Cody also, out of abundance of caution, added a second arg to
<code>main()</code> because some versions of clang object to the number
of args of <code>main()</code>, saying that it must be 0, 2 or 3. The
version this has been observed in does not actually object to 1 arg but
it is entirely possible that this changes so a second arg (that’s not
needed and is unused) has been added just in case.</p>
<p>Cody also added explicit linking of libm (<code>-lm</code>) for
systems that do not do this (Linux doesn’t seem to but macOS does).</p>
<p>Cody also added <a href="2018/bellard/index.html#alternate-code">alt
code</a> that should work for Windows, based on the author’s remarks.
The same thing with the number of args to <code>main()</code> that was
done in the original entry was done with this version as well.</p>

tried to run <code>tac(1)</code> (in systems that have that command)
rather than the entry itself which is called <code>tac</code> and the
<code>runtest</code> script (which he renamed to <code>runtest.sh</code>
for download/browser display purposes) was not executable.</p>
<p>Cody also renamed <code>manpage</code> to <code>manpage.sh</code> for
download/browser purposes and he did the same with <code>tokenfix</code>
to <code>tokenfix.sh</code> as well as <code>spotcheck</code> to
<code>spotcheck.sh</code>, <code>spotdiff</code> to
<code>spotdiff.sh</code>, <code>freqcount</code> to
<code>freqcount.sh</code> and <code>mkkeywords</code> to

<p>Cody also made the man page properly formatted for
<code>man(1)</code> and renamed it the file <code>tac.1</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also renamed <code>discrepancies</code> to
<code>discrepancies.html</code> and made it markdown format.</p>
<p>Cody added the <a href="2018/burton2/tokcount.sh">tokcount.sh</a>

one at a time and after each one is shown, it feeds it to the program,
redirecting the output to the respective GIF file. It then will inform
the user they should open it in a GIF viewer that can show animation in
animated GIF files. It offers an example command for macOS like the
judges did in their remarks. The input files offered includes the prog.c

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a>, based on the author’s remarks, made it
possible to save state between runs of the program so that one can
resume where they left off. It should be noted that there is a bug in
the entry (irrespective of save state option) where running
<code>./prog</code> twice in a row involves having to hit (the second
run) enter and then exit and then start the program again. Also if you
do add a file you should run <code>sync</code> prior to exiting or else
the file might not exist or it might be corrupt. See <a

href="2019/mills/index.html">2019/mills</a> (after running
<code>make</code>) so that one can not worry about having the entire
IOCCC winning entry tree (or at least the 2019 tree each entry in a
subdirectory). This is more important as there is discussion of having
tarballs for each individual entry as a convenience.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a
href="2019/diels-grabsch2/try.sh">try.sh</a> script. This script will
try and show the difference (i.e. the same output) between the program
and the result of <code>sha512sum</code> or <code>shasum -a 512</code>
if either of those tools can be found but otherwise it’ll just run the
program itself, showing its own sha512sum value.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added explicit linking of libm
(<code>-lm</code>) for systems that do not do this (Linux does not seem
to but macOS does).</p>
<p>He also fixed the Makefile so that it compiles with clang in
Linux.</p>
<p>He also added the <a href="2019/dogon/try.sh">try.sh</a> script.</p>
<p>He also made it possible to easily redefine the memory macro
<code>Z</code> at compilation time by modifying the Makefile.</p>
<p>He fixed a link in the spoiler source code. As a spoiler it felt more
important that this was done (some typos were fixed as well but only
some - the purpose was to only correct spelling and only some, not to
change wording or anything else).</p>
<h2 id="duble-index.html"><a name="2019_duble"></a><a

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> made the <code>make fullscreen</code> more
portable by not relying on <code>stty(1)</code> and <code>sed(1)</code>
but rather it just uses <code>tput(1)</code>. He also made it so that if
<code>tput(1)</code> is not found it tells the user an easier way to
compile the full screen size rather than having to modify the Makefile.
This done with a script, <a
href="2019/duble/fullscreen.sh">fullscreen.sh</a>, to simplify the
Makefile and provide an easy way to tell the user how to compile it,
assuming that the environmental variables <code>LINES</code> and
<code>COLUMNS</code> are set. But even if they’re not set it explains
how to easily compile the program to a specific size. Note that
<code>LINES</code> and <code>COLUMNS</code> is not available to scripts
so it can’t make use of them that way.</p>

href="2019/endoh/prog.c">2019/endoh</a> (<a

<p>As this is a backtrace quine having the optimiser enabled is not a
good idea so <a href="#cody">Cody</a> disabled it. For this same reason
he also added the <code>-g</code> flag to the compilation as debugging
symbols might just be useful for an entry that’s supposed to segfault
:-)</p>
<p>Cody also added the simple <a href="2019/endoh/ascii.c">ascii.c</a>
that (while it has an arg) prints out the character of the ASCII value
(uses <code>isascii(3)</code> first). This combined with the <a
href="2019/endoh/try.sh">try.sh</a> script that he added allows one to
easily reconstruct the source code through GDB by the fact it’s a
backtrace quine.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> reported that with <code>-O</code> level
&gt; 0 this program segfaults (sometimes?). He’s not sure why as it
worked fine before on the same systems tested but <code>-O0</code>
appears to fix the problem in both macOS and Linux. Perhaps this is the
problem that the author reported where it sometimes segfaults but Cody
did not try debugging it since it works with <code>-O0</code>.</p>
<p>He also added the script <a href="2019/karns/try.sh">try.sh</a> to
showcase the entry a bit more easily.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the missing <code>docs</code> rule to
the Makefile that forms a PDF file. The rule requires the tool <a

<p>Cody also added the <a

<p>Cody also added the <a href="2019/poikola/try.sh">try.sh</a> and <a
href="2019/poikola/try.alt.sh">try.alt.sh</a> scripts.</p>
<p>Cody also disabled the optimiser because the author stated that for
clang the levels [0123s] work okay but with GCC (6) they only said level
0 works, suggesting that with some versions of GCC it might not be
correct with levels != 0 and since 0 works with clang that’s okay.
Similarly, the same for C standards tested: <code>gnu17</code> was not
tested but <code>gnu11</code> was so the standard was set to
<code>gnu11</code>.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

updating the <a href="2019/yang/sample_input.txt">sample_input.txt</a>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the script <a
href="2020/burton/check_be.sh">check_be.sh</a>: it assumed that
<code>prog_be</code> was in <code>PATH</code> which is unlikely so it
was changed to <code>./prog_be</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also improved the <code>make test</code> rule (which uses
<code>check_be.sh</code> and the Little Endian counterpart) so that it
shows that the files are identical rather than showing nothing at
all.</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a href="2020/burton/try.sh">try.sh</a>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

glance might not appear to have a point, it actually does, namely
showing how you can automate play and then reminding you to actually
play for real, with a friend, whether that’s real or imagined.</p>

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the script <a

error when running it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb74"><pre

<p>If run from within vim a different error message occurred:</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash: ./run_clock.sh: /usr/bin/end: bad interpreter: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>though this was only noticed later on after it was fixed.</p>
<p>What was wrong? A typo in the shebang which had
<code>/usr/bin/end</code> instead of <code>/usr/bin/env</code>. Anyone
who knows Cody would know that he’d zoom in on that quite quick.</p>
<p>Also if <code>clock</code> did not exist and one tried to run the
script it would make an invalid <code>clock.c</code> which meant it
could not compile so it now runs <code>make clock</code> first.</p>
<p>Cody also reported (during the preview period of 2020) for some
systems (at some point?) like macOS the use of <code>make clock</code>
would not work due possibly to a timing issue so <a
href="#yusuke">Yusuke</a> changed it to compile the <a
href="2020/endoh3/clock.c">clock.c</a> file directly (this might have
been fixed in the Makefile later on but it doesn’t hurt to keep it in
and this way it isn’t a problem in any system). How Cody remembers this
minor detail more than three years ago is something that many people
might wonder but he also once told us that if someone moves something of
his even a millimetre from where it was he knows it so he might be
called unusual (and he argues, with pride, eccentric :-) ) :-)</p>
<p>Cody also added the <a

analogous to the <a href="2020/endoh3/run_clock.sh">run_clock.sh</a> but

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> added the <a

conversion of <code>pi.wav</code> (showing the digits) and also converts
the number for <code>jenny.wav</code> and a number Cody ‘came up with’:
one that resembles <code>IOCCC 28</code>: <code>10666-28</code>. The
<code>6</code> is the closest to <code>C</code> in his head even though
it’s not perfect.</p>
<p>If <code>play(1)</code> from SoX is not installed the script checks
for <code>aplay(1)</code>. If neither are installed it warns the user
about this, linking to the FAQ about it, and tells them they will have
to play the WAV files manually. Otherwise it’ll use the program to play
the WAV files (and in one case <code>stdout</code>).</p>

shellcheck(1), make sure the program is compiled first (allowing one to
specify which compiler to use with

<h1 id="general-thanks"><a name="general_thanks"></a>General thanks</h1>
<h2
id="makefiles-fixes-and-improvements"><a name="makefiles_fixes_improvements"></a>Makefiles
fixes and improvements</h2>
<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a> fixed the top level Makefile
<code>all</code> rule which had a stray <code>fi;</code> without an
<code>if</code> so the rule failed entirely.</p>
<p>Cody also made a variety of other changes in all the Makefiles,
sometimes to get an entry to work, all noted above, but he also
<strong>improved them all</strong> in at least one or two ways. Some of
the changes made are below.</p>
<p>Cody changed the <code>LIBS</code> variable to <code>LDFLAGS</code>
as that is the standard variable. This simplifies compiling without
having to modify the Makefile which can be useful if something changes
or if someone is trying to fix an entry but forgets to change the
Makefile or even if they don’t want to make a change due to a temporary
test. These would of course depend on the compiler invocation but since
<code>LDFLAGS</code> is standard it is more likely to be used by default
so no need to check the Makefiles.</p>
<p>Sometimes there were bad characters or rules that caused the entry to
fail to compile or not work in some way.</p>
<p>Where useful he added some notes to the Makefiles during compilation
to let one know of certain problems or features that matter for instance
having to disable the optimiser or enabling (in one case)
<code>-g</code>.</p>
<p>Also, rather than check <code>$(CC)</code> for exact matches of
<code>gcc</code> or <code>clang</code> it now is that if
<code>$(CC)</code> contains <code>gcc</code> or contains
<code>clang</code> then the specific actions related to the specific
compiler will be done (priority is gcc then clang). This is useful
because it’s not guaranteed that the compiler names for <code>gcc</code>
or <code>clang</code> will be exactly that; in macOS for instance it can
happen that they are in fact different names especially if one installs
them from something like <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>
or possibly <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>.</p>
<p>There were some other fixes as well including mass typo fixes in the
Makefiles (though that usually does not mean it is worth a thank you
note it might be worth noting in this case). Other times it was enabling
or disabling the optimiser to fix an entry, sometimes causing other
problems that also had to be fixed, a good example being <a
href="#1986marshall-readmemd">1986/marshall</a> (see the <a
href="1986/marshall/compilers.html">compilers.html</a> for the amusing
details and all that had to be done to fix it).</p>
<p>There was a ‘problem’ where <code>${MAKE}</code> was
<code>$(MAKE)</code>: this doesn’t break anything but it is inconsistent
with the rest of the <code>${foo}</code> tools even if by tradition it
is <code>$(MAKE)</code>.</p>
<p>Cody also added missing variables like <code>BASH</code> and
<code>PDFLATEX</code> to the <a href="var.mk">var.mk</a> file and
removed another that was deemed problematic or undesired. Other variable
names had typos in them.</p>
<p>A comment was missing for the <code>diff_alt_orig</code> rule in all
the Makefiles and this, along with many other fixes and changes to the
Makefiles were made by Cody’s <a
href="https://github.com/xexyl/sgit">sgit tool</a> but many other
changes he did manually.</p>
<h2
id="consistency-improvements"><a name="consistency_improvements"></a>Consistency

<p><a href="#cody">Cody</a>, being the IOCCC’s resident corrections
officer :-) (and a fine one at that, we think :-) ), made many, many
typ0 (… :-) ) fixes throughout the index.html files, scripts, other data
files, Makefiles (see above) etc.</p>
<p>He also updated the formatting of the index.html files (after
renaming the old files to index.html) to proper markdown.</p>
<p>Where possible he made the presentation of the entries much more
consistent across the entries of all the years as well as other files.
This is not possible for everything (the remarks of authors, for
instance, cannot be and should not be made consistent but adding
markdown where necessary in the remarks is).</p>
<p>A lot of these fixes were done with his <a

href="../authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> who
is responsible for most of the improvements and fixes including many
<strong>EXTREMELY HARD bug fixes</strong> like <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#1988_phillipps">1988/phillipps</a>, <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#1992_vern">1992/vern</a>, <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#2001_anonymous">2001/anonymous</a>, <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#2004_burley">2004/burley</a> and <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#2005_giljade">2005/giljade</a>, making
entries like <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#1985_sicherman">1985/sicherman</a> and <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#1986_wall">1986/wall</a> not need
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> (all <strong>EXTREMELY HARD</strong>),
fixing entries to work with clang (some <strong>EXTREMELY HARD</strong>
like <a href="thanks-for-help.html#1991_dds">1991/dds</a>) or as much as
possible (<a href="thanks-for-help.html#1989_westley">1989/westley</a>,
a true masterpiece that is <strong>INCREDIBLY HARD, <em>MUCH MORE
SO</em> than any other fix!</strong>), porting entries to macOS (some
<strong>EXTREMELY HARD</strong> like <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#1998_schweikh1">1998/schweikh1</a>, fixing
code like <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#2001_herrmann2">2001/herrmann2</a> to work in
both 32-bit/64-bit which <em>can be</em> <strong>EXTREMELY
HARD</strong>, providing alternate code where useful/necessary,
improving <strong>ALL <em>Makefiles</em></strong>, writing scripts to
greatly simplify running many of the entries and writing <a
href="https://github.com/xexyl/sgit">sgit</a> to easily run
<code>sed</code> on files in the repo to help build the website.</p>
<p>Cody Boone Ferguson also used one of his own tools to detect many
dead links. While the tool was not perfect it went a long way to uncover
a good number of bad, broken or otherwise invalid links. It was a very
laborious task to copy and paste problematic links into the <a
href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> in an effort
to try and find otherwise lost content. A good number of links that now
refer to something in the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet
Wayback Machine</a> replace bad, broken, or otherwise invalid links are
thanks to Cody’s efforts! Another tool he wrote detected inconsistent
award titles in the README files and CSV file (that he generated from
the SQL file).</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU VERY MUCH</strong> for your extensive efforts in
helping improve the IOCCC presentation of past IOCCC entries and fixing
almost all past entries for modern systems!</p>
