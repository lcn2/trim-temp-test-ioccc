### Bugs and (Mis)features:

The current status of this entry is:

```
STATUS: INABIAF - please **DO NOT** fix
```

For more detailed information see [1990 theorem bugs](../../bugs.html#1990_theorem).


## To use:

```sh
./theorem expression x1 x2 h y1
```

where:

```
expression - function f(x,y)  (see below)
x1 - start of interval
x2 - end of interval
h - step size
y1 - initial value  (y(x1) == y1)
```


## Try:

```sh
./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

The program's source implements four functions, all from the
same source file!

When you compile [theorem.c](theorem.c) as is and run with 5 args, it
numerically solves the equation `y'=f(x,y)`, with a step size of `h` (see above
usage), over the interval `x=[x1,x2]`, with the initial condition of `y(x1)=y1`.

The 'expression' `f(x,y)` is any function of `x` and `y` with the
operators:

```
+	-	*	/	^
```

The symbol `^` is the power operator.  Note that it only supports
integer powers.  Also note that all expressions are evaluated strictly
left to right.  (i.e., parenthesis aren't supported).

Try running the program with the following args:

```sh
./theorem y 0 1 0.1 1
./theorem 1/x 1 2 0.1 0
./theorem 'x^2/y+x' 0 1 0.1 6
```

But wait, there is more!  You also get, free of charge, a
reversing filter!  Try:

```sh
./theorem -r 0 0 0 0 < theorem.c > sorter.c
```

Still not impressed?  The author throws in for free, a
sort program! Try:

```sh
make sorter
ls | ./sorter
```

This program is safe for home use as well.  The author has
included a safety feature in case you misplace the original
program source:

```sh
./sorter -r 0 0 0 0 < sorter.c > theorem_bkp.c
```

And finally, as a special offer to users of this entry,
the author provides a Fibonacci sequence generator!  Try:

```sh
./sorter 0 0 0 0 < theorem.c > fibonacci.c
make fibonacci
./fibonacci 1 1
./fibonacci 2 1
```

NOTE: if the two args passed to `fibonacci` and `theorem_bkp` add to 0 it will
print 0 over and over again in an infinite loop. In this case it should not be
fixed (another condition where this occurred was fixed in 2023 as it affected
usability of the program).

Program available on 9 track and cartridge cassette.  Neither [Ginsu
knife](https://ginsu.com) nor [Swiss army
knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife) included! :-)

When this program was first shown at the 1990 Summer USENIX conference, it
received a standing ovation; a first for a contest entry.


## Author's remarks:

Differential equations are solved via the Runge-Kutta method, which guarantees
local error proportional to `h^5`, and total error across a finite interval is at
most a constant times `h^4`.

Sorting is accomplished with a standard [shell
sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort).

Note that the sorting and reversing is limited to files with fewer than 500
lines, each less than 99 characters long.
