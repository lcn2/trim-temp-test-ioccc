## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make all
```

There is an [alternate version](#alternate-code) that does something different
that can be used if your compiler is incapable of compiling `X=g()...` in
`main()`. It can be used for another purpose too.


## To use:

```<!---sh-->
    ./pjr
```


## Alternate code:

Note that some compilers will be unable to compile the expression `X=g()...` in
`main()` due to lack of temporary stack space.  One might want to try replacing
`main()` with:

```<!---c-->
    main(){X=s().v().o().o().l().S().d().l().i().o().w().N();}
```

if this is a problem, which is what this alternate code is.

NOTE: it prints something else and it is what the author suggested one try as
well.


### Alternate build:

```<!---sh-->
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

```<!---sh-->
    ./pjr.alt
```


## Judges' remarks:

This program prints out a string.  Can you figure out how
it is done?

By use of pointers to functions returning a struct of pointers
to functions!


### Spoiler:

This program prints out the string:

## Author's remarks:

It is simple to make the program print other strings.  Each
alphabetical character from a to z is printed out as its
opposite:

```
    a->z b->y c->x etc
```

To encode a new string input the string as it is meant to come out:

```<!---c-->
    X=s().v().o().o().l().S().d().l().i().o().w().N();
```

Note: `S()` represents a space and `N()` a newline.  This will now
produce...

```
    hello world
```

By the way, there is actually a piece of code which is not used
in the original program! I leave it as an intellectual exercise
to the reader to find out what it is.
