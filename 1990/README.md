Look at the README.md file for the given winner for information
on how to compile the winner and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's comments for even more details.

This year, the Grand Prize won a standing ovation at USENIX.

The "Strangest abuse of the rules" award was given this year to stress
the fact that starting in 1991, entries should be shell-specific.

This year was the first year that we accepted ANSI C entries.  It was
interesting to note that the ANSI C entries were as a whole less
portable than the K&R C entries.  We hope that in future contests
people will enter more obfuscated and challenging ANSI C programs.

We would like to thank Barbara Frezza (loving wife of Larry Bassel) for
her role as official chef of the contest.  Her opinions regarding
some of the contest entries were appreciated.

Rules and results were posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix, and
alt.sources.  They have been made available on a wide number of Usenet
archive sites such as uunet.
