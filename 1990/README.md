# 1990 marked the "The Seventh International Obfuscated C Code Contest"

Look at the README.md file for the given winning entry for information
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

This year, the Grand Prize won a standing ovation at USENIX.

The ["Strangest abuse of the rules"](1990/stig/README.md) award was given this
year to stress the fact that starting in 1991, entries should be shell-specific.

This year was the first year that we accepted ANSI C entries.  It was
interesting to note that the ANSI C entries were as a whole less portable than
the K&R C entries.  We hope that in future contests people will enter more
obfuscated and challenging ANSI C programs.

We would like to thank Barbara Frezza (loving wife of Larry Bassel) for
her role as official chef of the contest.  Her opinions regarding
some of the contest entries were appreciated.

[Rules](rules.txt) and [results](https://www.ioccc.org/years.html#1990) were
posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix, and alt.sources.  They have been made
available on a wide number of USENET archive sites such as uunet.
