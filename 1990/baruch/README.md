# Best Small Program

## To build:

```sh
make all
```

There is [alternate code](#alternate-code) for those using Turbo-C or MSC.


## To use:

```sh
echo 4 | ./baruch
echo 7 | ./baruch
```


### Try:

```sh
echo 2 | ./baruch
echo 3 | ./baruch
```

Why is there no output?

## Alternate code:

This alternate code is for the [very few](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0)
[users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)
[here](https://www.ioccc.org) who will need it but nonetheless if you're using
Turbo-C or MSC, the code is based on the authors' remarks except that the `"
#Q"` string was not changed as that showed worse looking output instead of
improved output though admittedly we have no way to test the compilers in
question. YMMV.

### Alternate build:

```sh
make alt
```

### Alternate use:

Use `baruch.alt` as you would `baruch`.


## Judges' remarks:

This program reads an integer between 4 and 99 from the `stdin`.

NOTE: The original program did not have a newline at the end of the file.  We
added a final newline to the file to make unpacking easy.

## Authors' remarks:

The goal of this work was to write a program that solves the classic [n-queens
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), with a board size
of up to 99x99, while keeping the program as short as possible.

The program finds all possibilities to place N chess queens on a NxN
[chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chessboard) so that no queen is in
range of any other queen (not in the same column row or diagonal).  For each
solution the chess board and the place of the queens is printed to stdout.

This program is about as simple and as readable as possible.  To make things
even more simple we used a very limited subset of C:

- No pre-processor statements
- Only one, harmless, `for` statement
- No `if`s
- No `break`s
- No `case`s
- No functions outside the standard C library
- No `goto`s
- No structures

In short, it contains no C language that might confuse the innocent reader. :-)

This program demonstrates the claim that in C, any program
can be written using a single 'for' statement, as long as it is
long enough..

### For PC users:

In order to compile the program under Turbo-C or MSC,  `int ` should be inserted
at the beginning of the program.  For better looking results it is recommended
to replace the `" #Q"` string with `" \261\2"`.
