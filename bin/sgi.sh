# sgi.sh - sort .gitignore canonically from stdin to stdout
#
# We canonicalize .gitignore lines as follows:
#
# We print lines # in the order they appear, 1st.
# We dictionary sort with lines starting with * 2nd.
# We dictionary sort with lines starting with ! 3rd.
# We dictionary sort with lines starting with / 4th.
# We dictionary sort all other lines 5th.
#
# For each step past the 1st step, we remove duplicate lines.
#
# Example usage in vim with a keyboard macro <escape>f:
#
#	:map ^[f 1G!G../../bin/sgi.sh^M
#
#     or via .vimrc:
#
#	" sort the entire .gitignore file using ../../bin/sgi.sh
#	:map  ^[f 1G!G../../bin/sgi.sh^M
#
#     NOTE: The ^[ above is ((Escape)) and ^M is ((Control-M)).
#
# Example usage in shell:
#
#	rm -f t && ../../bin/sgi.sh < .gitignore > t && mv -f t .gitignore
