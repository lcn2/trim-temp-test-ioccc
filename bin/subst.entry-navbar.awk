#
# subst.entry-navbar.awk - output substitutions for navbar on behalf of an entry
#
# This tool is usually invoked from the bin/subst.entry-index.sh output tool.
# That tool, in turn, is usually invoked by:
#
#	-o bin/subst.entry-index.sh
#
# IMPORTANT: Each command line option / argument MUST be printed on a separate line!
#
# usage:
#
#	awk -v entry_path=YYYY/dir -f bin/subst.entry-navbar.awk YYYY/.year
#
# usage:
#
#	awk -v entry_path=YYYY/dir -f bin/subst.entry-navbar.awk .allyear
#
# where:
#
#	YYYY	IOCCC year or mock
#	dir	name of entry directory under YYYY
