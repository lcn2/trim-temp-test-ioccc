# subst.year-navbar.awk - output substitutions for navbar on behalf of a year
#
# This tool is usually invoked from the bin/subst.year-index.sh output tool.
# That tool, in turn, is usually invoked by:
#
#	-o bin/subst.year-index.sh
#
# IMPORTANT: Each command line option / argument MUST be printed on a separate line!
#
# usage:
#
#	awk -v year_arg=YYYY -f bin/subst.year-navbar.awk .top
#
# where:
#
#	YYYY	IOCCC year or mock
