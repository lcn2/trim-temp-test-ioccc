# How to submit to the IOCCC

## Submit to the IOCCC

0. Verify that the [IOCCC is open](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html#enter) for
submissions.

1. If the IOCCC is open, you need to register as a contestant.  See [how to
enter](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html#enter) for how to register.

2. Once you have been registered, you will receive an email message for how to
prepare your entries for submission, and how to upload the compressed tarballs
to our submission portal.

3. Once the [IOCCC](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html#enter) closes, the judges
will select the [winning entries](https://www.ioccc.org/years.html) announce them
on the [@IOCCC mastodon feed](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc), notify the winners
via email using their previously registered email address, and upload the
winning code to the [winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner)
which in turn will cause them to be displayed on the [IOCCC winning entries
page](https://www.ioccc.org/years.html).
