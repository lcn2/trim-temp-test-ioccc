# A todo list of known things to check and/or do
*Last updated: Fri 02 Feb 2024 16:39:08 UTC*

This document is for [Cody Boone Ferguson](/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) as
he (that is I :-) ) wanted a way to keep track of things in a way that did not
require the information getting lost in the thousands of changes in the repo and
because it might be too much to add to the todo list in the issues themselves.

More things will likely be added over time and as items are done they _should
be_ removed from the list IF AND ONLY IF (!!) we are _absolutely certain_ it is
done (many times it's thought that a task was done only to find out it wasn't).

Every so often this file is checked and updated to remove items and when
something needs to be done is thought of it is also updated unless it can be
done right then and there or it seems more appropriate to add to the issue (#3)
todo list.

- Typo fix ALL markdown files. For the README.md files the entries have all been
done (along with format fixes) but the YYYY/README.md files have not been
completed.
    * Go through all year README.md files: that is 1984/README.md,
    1985/README.md and so on. As of **Mon 16 Oct 11:22:52 UTC 2023** the
    following years have had a first pass: 1984 through 2001. However there are
    changes that might be required in those years too so a pass over all of them
    will have to be done at the time the files are to be reviewed.

- Check the [GitHub issue #3 comment
1615962832](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/issues/3#issuecomment-1615962832)
for links about the todo items wrt the [FAQ](/faq.md).

- Check 2001/westley for making `main()` have two args. Easy to make it have two
args but harder to make it function right.

- Check for video links in README.md files and see if the videos can be
embedded into the README.md files themselves. An entry that the video file is
downloaded already is 2006/sykes1. There are others that I need to look at once
the rest of the entries are done, assuming that it's possible.

- Test and fix as and if necessary 2018/ferguson/weasel.spec.

- Update formatting in 2020/ferguson[12]/chocolate-cake.md specifically with
bold versus bold and italic in important points.
