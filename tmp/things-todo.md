# A todo list of known things to check and/or do
*Last updated: Thu 07 Mar 2024 18:16:13 UTC*

This document is for [Cody Boone Ferguson](/authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) as
he (that is I :-) ) wanted a way to keep track of things in a way that did not
require the information getting lost in the thousands of changes in the repo and
because it might be too much to add to the todo list in the issues themselves.

More things will likely be added over time and as items are done they _should
be_ removed from the list IF AND ONLY IF (!!) we are _absolutely certain_ it is
done (many times it's thought that a task was done only to find out it wasn't).

Every so often this file is checked and updated to remove items and when
something needs to be done is thought of it is also updated unless it can be
done right then and there or it seems more appropriate to add to the issue (#3)
todo list.

- Check that the following todo tasks at:
    <https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/issues/3#issuecomment-1583833132>
    and
    <https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/issues/3#issuecomment-1583829356>

    have been finished. It is quite possible that some or all of these have been
    corrected by now but this has not yet been determined.
