# How to fix an IOCCC entry

If you see a problem with an IOCCC entry, first check the
[known bugs](bugs.md) file.  In some cases what you might think
of as a bug is instead a known feature.  On some cases the
bug is known, but no fix has ever been submitted.  In other
cases you may have found a new problem.

If you do have a fix, and the [known bugs](bugs.md) file **does
not recommend against fixing it**, then please opening a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) against the master
[branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the [ioccc-src/winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) repo.

BTW: A **problem** is not limited to the code itself.  Fixing typos in files such
as "_README.md_" files, fixing issues in a "_Makefile_", or otherwise correcting an
IOCCC winner is **VERY MUCH WELCOME**!  Please use the same [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process against the master
[branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the [ioccc-src/winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) repo.

**Please help us fix typos and / or otherwise improve the write-up** of
how IOCCC winning entries are presented!

And of course, an IOCCC winner's may update their own entries
(metadata as well as source code and any extra files) by opening a
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls)
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner)
repo.
