## Judges' remarks:

Trigraphs are natural obfuscators.  Most C-beautifiers become C-uglifiers
because they don't handle them correctly.

Can you figure out how it prints a given random line (or if the line is longer
than 231 characters, part of that line) from stdin?


## Author's remarks:

All input lines must be under 232 characters long.  The compiling
platform should be ASCII based.
