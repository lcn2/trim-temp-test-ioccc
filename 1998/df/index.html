<p>This will run the program in a loop until you exit (<code>q</code> when prompted or
ctrl-c/intr).</p>
<p>Can you figure out a very simple pipeline to cheat?</p>
<h2 id="judges-remarks">Judges’ remarks;</h2>
<p>Everyone talks about how data hiding can produce clearer code; I am
pleased to offer this charming refutation.</p>
<p>The program is a simple game. A bit of observation reveals that the
game has some data - but where? It’s unclear which of the contents of
the program are used.</p>
<p>Curiously, the program only works if its source is in the directory
it’s run in. More curiously, the program would fail if the program’s
name’s second letter wasn’t <code>r</code> (the source has been changed for your
convenience and this restriction no longer exist).</p>
<p>Modern design has come a long way since the unreadable, tightly-coupled
systems we used to have.</p>
<p>Extra credit questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are the words stored?</li>
<li>How many words does this entry use?</li>
<li>Can you add more words to the program and still make it work?</li>
<li>Are there any misspelt words? If yes what are they?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="authors-remarks">Author’s remarks:</h2>
<p>This program lets you guess English words. It displays an underscore
for each letter in the word; guessing a letter that actually is in
the word replaces the corresponding underscores with the letter
itself. You can guess a letter simply by typing it in. If your C
implementation requires it, you may have to hit Return before it
is recognized. In this case, you can also type multiple guesses
on the same line (completely solve it by entering
<code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code>). Execution stops when all underscores
have been replaced.</p>
<p>The program offers a number of different words to guess, <code>time()</code> is
used to pick one at random. All words are eight characters long.</p>
<p>The source should compile with any ANSI C compiler (I used CodeWarrior
w/ ANSI strict). Using non-ANSI compilers that implement the ANSI
features it uses will not work (unless they defined <code>__STDC__ 1</code>
which they shouldn’t). Due to space restrictions, I did not use
any trigraph sequences. It does not require any special <code>-D</code> defines.</p>
<p>The source passes lint without any complaint (if invoked with
<code>&gt;/dev/null</code>). (My lclint is unable to recover from some parts of it.)</p>
<p>Actually, the code not only is compliant with the ANSI specifications, but uses
a near minimum subset of them. C keywords that were not used have been
re(de)fined to avoid unnecessary introduction of new, unknown character
patterns. The source also includes all ANSI headers it needs (after most of the
functions have been used), and the declaration of <code>main()</code> follows the
guidelines (but the return type has a different meaning and the arguments are
either misused or unused). There also may be some compiler warnings. These are
not bugs, but features. The more warnings, the better the compiler. There
wouldn’t be any if I had been allowed to use some extra space for prototypes
etc.</p>
<p>Multiple defines are used (but not all of them define), and <code>#define y define</code> is used with <code>#y</code> but the code doesn’t assume <code>#y</code> to expand
to <code>#define</code>. I have also included comments in the code, and vital
code in the comments. And of course there is code that doesn’t do
anything but will crash the program if it is removed (just like
those comments I mentioned above). Additionally, since you said
you’d be preprocessing entries ignoring <code>#include</code>s I figured I should
use some more of them instead of other obfuscation methods. Did
I mention that preprocessed or beautified sources will crash or
hang your system? The program will also crash on non-ASCII machines.</p>
<p>The executable needs its source file present in the current directory
or, depending on your system, in your path. The name of the source
file is not hard-coded, <code>__FILE__</code> is used instead.</p>
<p>In the original version which was sent in to the contest, there were
some restrictions on the file name:</p>
<ul>
<li>The second letter had to be a lowercase <code>r</code>.</li>
<li>The third letter could never be a <code>+</code> or a <code>b</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valid names would have been <code>pr4.c</code>, <code>pr.c</code>, <code>prog.c</code>, <code>brownie.c</code> etc.
My first private version would only run when compiled on a Friday.
I decided it would be better this way…
These restrictions have been removed for your convenience.</p>
<p>The following lines describe how this program works; if you don’t
want to know it at this time, please skip them. If this entry would
by some mistake win the contest, please do not rot13 this - I hate
rot13 spoilers since it is somewhat complicated on a Mac to
reverse them. Anyone out there should have enough discipline and
rot13 shouldn’t be required, really. After all, we are not children
anymore :-)</p>
<hr />
<p>This paragraph is not part of the author’s remarks, but is a helpful
gift from the judges; if you read too fast to stop yourself, this should
give you enough time to stop, which you really need to do RIGHT NOW if
you don’t want to read the spoilers, which really do spoil everything,
we mean it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The source file needs to be present because the words are read from
it. The wordlist is encoded within the source using a 24 entry
sliding dictionary where lowercase letters are offsets into the
dictionary, uppercase letters are new letters not yet in the
dictionary, and all other characters are ignored. The words are
spread over six lines in the source; decoding starts on a line
after a tab and a whitespace have been found, and stops on a newline.
The grin after the “Demonic Smiley” actually is one encoded letter
while the string is completely ignored; and the <code>cut</code> in “cut here”
is required while <code>here</code> is not.</p>
<p>“For extra credit”, explain why the words are sorted alphabetically
(because I extracted them from a dictionary :-) )</p>
<p>The file name had to fulfill the restrictions mentioned above
because <code>__FILE__+1</code> was used as a second parameter to <code>fopen()</code>. (It
essentially was <code>fopen(__FILE__,__FILE__+1)</code> ). This was an extra joke
that doesn’t exist in the released version.</p>
<p>You probably discovered that the <code>while(FILE)</code> in <code>main()</code> is not a while loop
but the statement that opens the file and initializes the dictionary.
Similarly, <code>int</code> and <code>signed</code> have been redefined (to save space, of course).</p>
<p>The main function (the guessing part) is between the last <code>#else..#endif</code>,
but still is declared before <code>main()</code>. The <code>5[O]()</code> in <code>main()</code> calls
this function. Similarly, most indexing operations have been
changed to this form and I tried to write each such operation
different.</p>
