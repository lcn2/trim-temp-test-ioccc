## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./eastman
```

NOTE: to restore your cursor in your shell, try `reset`.


## Try:

Run the program. Quit it (ctrl-c/intr). Resize your terminal window. Run it
again. Try doing this a number of times with different sizes each time.

``` <!---sh-->
    ./eastman
```

NOTE: to restore your cursor in your shell, try `reset`.


## Judges' remarks:

This round program will generate a classic spherical result!

You will need a terminal capable of displaying coloured ANSI
characters (for example an xterm or a Terminal.app window in macOS).

You might also want to turn off any scrollback history. The program will
size itself to the initial geometry of your terminal.

If you are ambitious, make the font really small and the window really
large for hi-res graphics!


## Author's remarks:

This program uses ANSI graphics to recreate the classic Boing Ball demo from
the Commodore Amiga.  See <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ga41edXw3A> if you
aren't familiar with it. Back in its day, this demo inspired lust and awe in
geeks around the world.

The graphics are
[raytraced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_&#x28;graphics&#x29;), with
procedural textures on the ball and the back wall.  I did cheat a little to
simplify the calculations: it uses a parallel projection, but textures the back
wall to look as if there were a floor being viewed in perspective.  The shadow
is also just part of the texture, not an actual raytraced shadow.

This program automatically adapts to the size of the terminal it is running in,
so try enlarging the window to get higher resolution.  Don't resize while the
program is running, though.  It only checks the size once, when it starts up.

To compile:

``` <!---sh-->
    cc -lm eastman.c
```


### Portability

It should be completely portable.  I've tested with gcc on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)
and Fedora 10.  I would expect it to work in any Unix-like environment.


### Obfuscation

I have merged expressions wherever possible, making extensive use of ternary
operators, commas, return values of assignment operators, etc.  The entire
raytracing computation, include ray intersection tests and procedural texture
evaluations, is a single expression involving 41 operators.

Variables are named alphabetically in the order they are declared.

The third argument to `ioctl(2)` should really be a `struct winsize`, and I
should then look up the `ws_row` and `ws_col` fields, but that makes it way too
obvious what I'm doing there.  Since a `struct winsize` just contains four
`unsigned short`s, I replaced it with an array.  And since all the values will
be much less than `32767`, I further simplified the type to just `short[]`.

A wonderful thing about ANSI graphics is that it produces nearly unintelligible
code.  Consider the `printf(3)` spec to print a single space in a desired color:
`"\x1B[%dm `.  I could have done something to further obfuscate it, but it's
already indistinguishable from line noise, so why bother?

There are lots of other minor obfuscations to make the code less obvious.  For
example, I could have written the outer loop as `while(1)`, but why write a 1
when I can calculate it from the return value of `usleep(3)` instead? And I
could have written `usleep(80000)`, but `usleep(79383)` just looks so much
better.  And so on.
