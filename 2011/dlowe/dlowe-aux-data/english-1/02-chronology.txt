The provisional Government of National Defence (GND) is set   up: General Louis Jules Trochu (President), Leon Gambetta (Ministry of   Interior), Jules Favre (Ministry of Foreign Affairs).   September 6:   GND issues statement: blames war on Imperial government, it now wants   peace, but "not an inch of our soil, not a stone of our fortresses,   will we cede." Since Prussia demands Alsace-Lorraine, the war   continues.   September 19:   Two German armies begin long siege of Paris.  Bismarck figures the   "soft and decadent" French will quickly surrender.     The GND sends delegation to Tours, soon to be joined by Gambetta (who   escapes from Paris in a balloon), to organize resistance in the   provinces.   October 27:   French surrender (Bazaine with 173,000 men) at Metz.  October 30:   National Guard defeated at Le Bourget.  October 31:   Rebels storm GND at town hall.

Food brought into Paris.   Febuary 8:   Elections held in France.  Febuary 12:   New National Assembly opens at Bordeaux; two-thirds of members are   conservatives and wish the war to end.    February 16:   The Assembly elects Adolphe Thiers chief executive.   February 26:   Peace concluded with Bismarck: Alsace and one-third of Lorraine   surrendered (including Metz); France to pay enormous indemnity over   three years; German army of ocupation to slowly withdraw as indemnity   payments made.   March 1-3:   After months of struggle and suffering, Parisians react angrily to the   entry of German troops in the city.

It will now set up shop at Versailles on   March 20.   March 18:   Thiers wants to disarm Paris.

It is, however, never acted upon.   April 8:   All religious representations removed from Paris schools.  April 18:   Commune announces the postponement of all debt obligations for three   years.   April 30:    Thiers orders nationwide municipal elections.  May 10:   The peace treaty concluded in February now signed, known as Treaty of   Frankfurt. (Endorsed by National Assembly May 18.)  May 21-28:   The Fall of Paris.     Versailles troops enter Paris on May 21.  They now spend eight days   clearing resistance, which usually involved shocking massacres.    Operation led by Marshal MacMahon, who would later become president of   France.  Thousands of Communards and innocent Parisians summarily   executed (as many as 30,000); numerous others imprisoned and deported.    Death tolls as great as Terror of 1793-94.   eof
