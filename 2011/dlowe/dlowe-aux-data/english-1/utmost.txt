These are the places I was so sure I'd find Him
I've looked in the pages
And I've looked down on my knees
I've lifted my eyes in expectation
To see the sun still refusing to shine, but...


Sometimes He comes in the clouds
Sometimes His face cannot be found
Sometimes the sky is dark and gray
But some things can only be known
And sometimes our faith can only grow
When we can't see
So, sometimes He comes in the clouds


Sometimes I see me, a sailor out on the ocean
So brave and so sure as long as the skies are clear
But when the clouds start to gather
I watch my faith turn to fear, but...


Sometimes He comes in the clouds
Sometimes His face cannot be found
Sometimes the sky is dark and gray
But some things can only be known
And sometimes our faith can only grow
When we can't see
So, sometimes He comes in the clouds


Sometimes He comes in the rain
And we question the pain
And wonder why God can seem so far away
But time will show us
He was right there with us, and... 

 
   
   "Where He Leads Me" by Twila Paris

There's a great, broad road, through the meadow,
And many travel there,
But I have a gentle Shepherd,
I would follow anywhere,
Up a narrow path, Through the mountains,
To the valley far below,
To be ever in His presence,
Where He leads me I will go.

And there are many wondrous voices,
Day and night they fill the air,
But there is one so small and quiet,
I would know it anywhere,
In the city or in the wilderness,
There's a ringing crystal clear,
And to be ever close beside Him,
When He calls me I will hear.

Where He leads me, I will follow,
When He calls me I will hear.

There is a great, broad road to nowhere,
And so many travel there,
But I have a gentle Shepherd,
I would follow anywhere,
Though the journey take me far away,
From the place I call my home,
To be ever in His presence,
Where He leads me I will go.


  "You'll Be There" by Cindy Morgan

You were there when the lightning fell,
Crashing down in the blue night,
You came in like a raging wind all around,
What a sweet light. 
And in the darkness You were there,
And in the good times You were there,
So let me say, with a prayer,
Sweetest Savior who cares,
Angels dance in the air,
And tell us You'll be there.

In the days when the dark and haze gather round,
You're the refuge,
You breathe again and the sun shines in through the clouds,
How we need You,
To be near and to be sovereign,
Giving hope to each tomorrow,
So we say with a prayer,
Sweetest Savior who cares,
Angels dance in the air,
And tell us You'll be there.

Shadow the lightening,
When we are frightened,
Heavenly light keep shining on me,
Shining on me,
Everywhere,
Sweetest Savior who cares,
Angels dance in the air,
And tell us You'll be there.
