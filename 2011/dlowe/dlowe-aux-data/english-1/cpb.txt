Series Description:

Charles Paris, a mostly unemployed actor who is thrown into detective
work, is the creation of Simon Brett.  Mr. Brett authored seventeen
Charles Paris stories, starting with the first, "Cast, In Order Of
Disappearance", in 1975.  He was involved with the BBC for over 20
years as a producer and produced the pilot for "The Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy" radio series.  By 1979, Brett had become a full-
time writer.

The first two Charles Paris novels, "Cast, In Order Of Disappearance"
and "So Much Blood" were adapted for radio, each as a six episode
adventure serial and aired on BBC Radio Two.  Both serials were
adapted by Simon Brett.  The part of Charles Paris was played by
Francis Matthews who also played Paul Temple on BBC TV.

The "So Much Blood" serial was later repeated on BBC Radio Four,
starting on 23 August, 1989.  A new, one hour version of "So Much
Blood" was heard on BBC Radio Four on 21 August, 1999.
