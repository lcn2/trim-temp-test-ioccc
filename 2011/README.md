2011 marked the "The Twentieth International Obfuscated C Code Contest"
========================================================================


Standard IOCCC stuff
--------------------

Look at the README.md file for the given winning entry for information
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

The IOCCC has a web site and now has a number of international mirrors.
The primary site can be found at,

>	<https://www.ioccc.org/>

Use make to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Un\*x / non-Linux
systems the makefile needs to be changed.  See the Makefile for details.

This year we included most of the information included by the submitters
in the README.md files.

Read over the makefile for compile/build issues.  Your system may require
certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a #define).

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.


Remarks on some of the entries
------------------------------

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

+ did not follow the "one program - one file" rule;

+ depended too much on 32 bit architectures;

+ were more of the "obfuscated math" kind rather than the "obfuscated C" kind.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winners. The Best
of Show is a fine example of character stitching.  But don't ignore the other
winners!  There are games, puzzle solvers, utilities, eye candy, calculators and graphical and audio tools.

This year all winners are different, and there is a winner from a new country -
China!  Many winners won for the first time. (Please note that judging is done
completely anonymously.  Be warned that we may disqualify entries that reveal
the identity of the submitter).
