# The IOCCC FAQ


## <a name="faq0"></a>Section 0: Submitting entries to a new IOCCC


### <a name="faq0_0"></a><a name="submit"></a>FAQ 0.0: How may I submit to the IOCCC?

To submit your code to the IOCCC, you **MUST** follow these steps:

0. Verify that the IOCCC is open for submissions

    Check the [status.json](status.json) URL and
    check the [IOCCC news](news.html#news) to
    see of the IOCCC is open.

    You may only register for the IOCCC
    and you may only submit your entries to the IOCCC when the IOCCC is **OPEN**.

1. Read the latest IOCCC rules and review the IOCCC guidelines

    Please pay close attention to the [official IOCCC rules](rules.html).

    You are also **highly encouraged** to review the
    [official IOCCC guidelines](guidelines.html) as they contain important
    suggestions, useful hints, and IOCCC humor.  :-)

2. Register for the IOCCC

    The **IOCCC registration procedure** is still being designed.
    <!--XXX--> As such, we do not yet have instructions on how to
    use the **IOCCC registration procedure**.  Once **IOCCC
    registration procedure** is ready, we will update this section
    with the proper instructions.  Watch the [IOCCC news](news.html)
    for an annoucement about the **IOCCC registration procedure**.

    Once you have been registered, you will receive an email message for how to
    prepare your entries for submission, and how to upload the compressed tarballs
    to our submission portal.

3. Obtain the latest mkiocccentry toolkit

    If you do not have an mkiocccentry tool directory:

	cd some_directory
	git clone git@github.com:ioccc-src/mkiocccentry.git
	cd mkiocccentry

    If you already have an mkiocccentry tool directory:

	cd mkiocccentry
	git fetch
	git rebase

4. Make the mkiocccentry toolkit

	make clobber all

5. Run the mkiocccentry tool to form your entry tarball

        ./mkiocccentry work_dir prog.c Makefile remarks.md [file ...]

    where:

	work_dir	directory where the entry directory and tarball are formed
	prog.c		path to the C source for your entry


	Makefile	Makefile to build (make all) and cleanup (make clean & make clobber)

	remarks.md	Remarks about your entry in markdown format
			NOTE: See the [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) guide.

	[file ...]	extra data files to include with your entry

    NOTE: It is *NOT* necessary to install the tools to use them as you can run
    the tools from the top of the _mkiocccentry repo_ directory just fine.

    If `mkiocccentry` tool indicates that there is a problem with your entry,
    especially if it identifies a [rule 2](rules.html#2) related problem,
    you are **strongly** encouraged to revise and correct your entry and
    then re-run the `mkiocccentry` tool.

    If you choose to risk violating rules, be sure an explain your reason
    for doing so in your _remarks.md file.

6. Upload your entry to the IOCCC submit server

    The **IOCCC submit server** is still being written as of 2024
    Mar 10.  <!--XXX--> As such, we do not yet have instructions
    on how upload your entry to the **IOCCC submit server**.  Once
    **IOCCC submit server** is ready, we will update this section
    with the proper instructions.  Watch the [IOCCC news](news.html)
    for an annoucement of the availability of the **IOCCC submit server**.



### <a name="faq0_1"></a>FAQ 0.1: What types of entries have been over-submitted to the IOCCC?

There are types of entries that show up over and over again.  The
IOCCC judges, and we suspect the public that enjoy viewing the
results of the IOCCC, like variety.

While it is possible to win a new IOCCC with one of these
__over-submitted__ types of entries, level of the competition from
previous IOCCC entries make it more challenging to be successful.


It is also important to note that the [guidelines](guidelines.html) often
state something along the lines of:

> _We tend to dislike programs that: are similar to previous winning entries_

#### Hints on overused themes

HINT: It is not fatal to send in those types of entries, it is just MUCH
HARDER to win. Such an entry would have to do something _really unique **AND**
interesting_ to even make it into the final judging rounds. Entries that
reuse these 'worn out' themes frequently lose to other entries that do
something different.

HINT: If you really MUST send in an entry based on an 'overused theme', be sure
that it is obfuscated in several new and novel ways. Be sure to _clearly_
explain near the beginning of your remarks why you are submitting a entry based
on an 'overused theme' and why the judges should not simply toss it out as being
boring.


### <a name="faq0_2"></a>FAQ 0.2: What should I put in my entry's Makefile?

We recommend starting with the [sample
Makefile](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example)
as found in the [mkiocccentry GitHub repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry),
(renamed as `Makefile` of course) as a starting point for your
entry's `Makefile`.

The `Makefile` is a file used by the `make(1)` command that contains
rules and UNIX shell-style commands.

The first and default rule should be the "all" rule and should build your entry's executable file.

If your entry depends on a particular source file name during compilation or execution,
your `Makefile` should copy `prog.c` into the desired filename.  For example:

If you are not familiar `Makefile`s, you might consider the following tutorials:

- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)
- [What is a Makefile and how does it work?](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)
- [Learn Makefiles](https://makefiletutorial.com)

For the `make(1)` _connoisseur_: As of 2023, IOCCC judges use [GNU
make compatible](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) `make(1)`
command that is compatible with GNU Make version 3.81.


### <a name="faq0_3"></a>FAQ 0.3: May I use a different source or compiled filename than prog.c or prog?

While your entry's source filename, as submitted, must be `prog.c`, your entry's `Makefile`
may copy `prog.c` to a different filename as part of the compiling/building process.  For example:

```make
    all: desired_name

    desired_name: desired_name.c
	    cc desired_name.c -o $@

    desired_name.c: prog.c
	    rm -f $@
	    cp -f prog.c $@

    clobber:
	    rm -f desired_name.c desired_name
```

We recommend that the `make clobber` rule remove files that your entry
creates as part of the compiling/building process.

You may also copy the compiled `prog` into a different file as part of compiling process.
For example:

```make
    different_name: prog
	    rm -f $@
	    cp -f prog $@
```


### <a name="faq0_4"></a>FAQ 0.4: What platform should I assume for my entry?

Your entry must compile with GCC and run under at least one flavor of UNIX (e.g.
Linux or Solaris). To improve chances to win, it should work under both BSD and
SysV style UNIX (think **stty cbreak**), and should not depend on "Endianness".
If it can compile and run on Windows and/or Mac  (see
[2000/thadgavin](years.html#2000_thadgavin) for one example, amongst others),
even better. Being able to compile with other compilers like clang is also a
good thing.


## <a name="faq1"></a>Section 1: History of the IOCCC


### <a name="faq1_0"></a><a name="ioccc_start"></a>FAQ 1.0: How did the IOCCC get started?

One day (1984 March 23 to be exact), Larry Bassel and I (Landon Curt
Noll) were working for National Semiconductor's Genix porting group, we
were both in our offices trying to fix some very broken code.

Larry had been trying to fix a bug in the classic Bourne shell (C code `#define`d
to death to sort of look like Algol) and I had been working on the finger
program from early BSD (a bug ridden finger implementation to be sure).

We happened to both wander (at the same time) out to the hallway
in Building 7C to clear our heads.

We began to compare notes: '_You won't believe the code I am trying to fix_'.

And: '_Well you cannot imagine the brain damage level of the code I'm trying to
fix'_.

As well as: '_It's more than bad code, the author really had to try to make it
this bad!_

After a few minutes we wandered back into my office where I posted a
[flame to
net.lang.c](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=789%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=3&filter=0")
inviting people to try and out obfuscate the UN\*X source code we had just been working on.

BTW: I (Landon Curt Noll) had to post this [typo
correction](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=795%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=10&filter=0).
Thus began the tradition of putting typos in the contest rules and guidelines
... to make them more obfuscated of course! :-)

BTW: This posting was made back in the days when AT&amp;T was the evil giant.
Now, Microsoft makes AT&amp;T look mild and kind in comparison. :-( (IMHO) ).

BTW: See the story about the '[Bill Gates](1993/mills/index.html)' award. :-)

OK, back to the story.

We (Larry and I) received a number of entries by email.
When we began to receive messages from outside of the US, Larry and I
decided to include International in the name.

The
[1st IOCCC entries](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=2&filter=0)
were posted on 17 April 1984.

There were 4 entries that won in 1984:

1. [(dis)honorable mention](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=842%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=8&filter=0)
2.  [3rd place](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=843%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=7&filter=0)
3. [2nd place](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=844%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=6&filter=0)
4. [1st place](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=845%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=5&filter=0)

BTW: The (dis)honorable mention wished to remain anonymous.
While many have asked who it was, we have continued to follow the
author's wish to remain anonymous.

A few years ago, we asked the author if they still wanted to remain anonymous.
They said: '_Yes, I want to keep my anonymity.  But you can tell them that I am well known for my connection to the
C language_'. It was not until 2001 that another [anonymous
entry](years.html#2001_anonymous) received an award.

BTW: The [1984/mullender](years.html#1984_mullender) remains one of my (Landon Curt Noll) all time favorites.

The name used in the posting of the [1st winning IOCCC
entry](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=1983&as_maxd=18&as_maxm=4&as_maxy=1984&selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&rnum=2&filter=0)
posting was **I**nternational **O**bfuscated **C** **C**ode **C**ontest or
**IOCCC** for short.

The posting said '_1st annual_', so in 1985 we held the [2nd IOCCC contest](years.html#1985)
and the tradition continues as the longest running contest on the Internet.

P.S. Part of the inspiration for making the IOCCC a contest goes to the
[Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest](http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/).

P^2.S. See the [overall README](all/index.html) for more details.


### <a name="faq1_1"></a>FAQ 1.1: Why are some years missing IOCCC entries?

Some years, such as 1997, 1999, 2002-2003, 2007-2010, 2016-2017, 2021-2023, no IOCCC was held.

While we try to hold the IOCCC every year, sometime the other demands on the IOCCC judges
so not permit us to hold a new IOCCC.

The pause during the 2021-2023 period was due to the IOCCC judges developing tools to
make is much more likely for the IOCCC to be held in a yearly basis later on.


### <a name="faq1_2"></a>FAQ 1.2: What is the history of the IOCCC web site?

#### In the beginning of www.ioccc.org

The long history of the [official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org) can be
viewed at the [Internet Wayback Machine Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org).

One can [view several thousand snapshots showing how the IOCCC web site has
evolved](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/www.ioccc.org) going back
as far as [1998 Dec 12
www.ioccc.org](https://web.archive.org/web/19981212030016/https://www.ioccc.org/).

On 2020 Dec 31, the IOCCC source tree was moved to the [IOCCC winner
repo](https://web.archive.org/web/20210101211346/https://www.ioccc.org/) on
[GitHub](https://github.com).  From this point on, the [official IOCCC web
site](https://www.ioccc.org) became a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
web site.

#### 2020 Dec 28 bzip2 compressed tarball archive

Furthermore, a bzip2 compressed tarball containing the released
IOCCC entry source code may be found under the
[archive/historic](/archive/histroic) directory.  The file
[archive-all.tar.bz2](/archive/historic/archive-all.tar.bz2) contains
all years and the individual years are in the form
`archive/historic/archive-YYYY.tar.bz2`.

These files were obtained from the [Internet Wayback
Machine](https://web.archive.org) from the [snapshot of the website

#### 2020 IOCCC winning entries released using git via GitHub

The [winning
entries](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/9d61fc0fb4a3245afb1435458cfb597fad0e8e6a)
of the [IOCCC 2020](https://www.ioccc.org/years.html#2020),
after a far too long of a delay
(due in part to a [former IOCCC judge whose resignation was noted on
2021 Jan 04](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/c94fc84c35dc83e3eb9900720b95917a15c27afe))
from their initial [2020 Jul 25
announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20200726232505/http://www.ioccc.org:80/index.html),
were added by an [IOCCC judge](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html)
to their local [git](https://git-scm.com) repository and then were
merged into the [Official IOCCC winner repo on 2020 Dec
31](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/b1638ff0012964d79ab1c44aa815d3f824f35b6c).

[git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com).


#### 2020 Dec 30 thru 202y MMM DD - Work on the temp-test-ioccc GitHub repo

Starting on [2020 Dec
30](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/2f20ae8451ada03f4601ac727d10e1d8630861a8)
edits to the [Official IOCCC winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) began.

The local [git](https://git-scm.com) repository of an [IOCCC
judge](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) was [edited starting Wed
Dec 30 16:57:03 2020

and was occasionally committed to the [Official IOCCC winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

The [first accepted pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pull/2) to
the [Official IOCCC winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) was made
by [Yusuke Endoh](https://www.ioccc.org/winners.html#Yusuke_Endoh)  on [2021 Jan
5](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/84c62c4cbf56ac1351ea91e5019f51103615fda2).


Between [Wed Dec 30 16:57:03 2020

-0800](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/commit/098a3e7e04d43e480ecc4b5482c83274e1434002),
an [IOCCC judge](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) made edits to
their local repository with occasional pushes to the [Official IOCCC winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) and the [Official
www.ioccc.org web site](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html).  After
that time and until the **Great Fork Merge**, very few changes
were made to the [Official IOCCC winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) and the [Official
www.ioccc.org web site](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html) most of
which were news updates.

While the [temp-test-ioccc
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc) has history
going back to [2020 Dec
29](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/28efc67f5dd692a3544708bf7fa26286adb82dfb),
the repo was forked on **Sun Sep 18 17:30:00 2022 -0700**.  The
first [push into the temp-test-ioccc
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/edbc3089e1b755d85a020af7975bbc7df3737a5f)
occurred on Sun Sep 18 11:15:49 2022 -0700.

At this same time, the [temp-test-ioccc web site](https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/) went live.

Edits were made by an [IOCCC judge](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html)
to their local [git](https://git-scm.com) repository and [were pushed into the temp-test-ioccc
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/2f20ae8451ada03f4601ac727d10e1d8630861a8)
and to the [temp-test-ioccc web site](https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/).

The [first accepted pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pull/15)
made directly to the [temp-test-ioccc
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc) on
[Wed Feb 22 05:44:55 2023 -0800 with commit
11bb36ac8ce790f32a9a3e5d2131ee12820fb8ec](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/11bb36ac8ce790f32a9a3e5d2131ee12820fb8ec)
by [Cody Boone
Ferguson](https://www.ioccc.org/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson).

A [decision was made by the
IOCCC](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/discussions/1918) to
mostly use frequent commits to individual components of the IOCCC,
rather than to use occasional site wide massive updates in order
to improve the tractability of changes made to components of the
IOCCC such as IOCCC entries although occasionally site wide updates
were performed in order to address an issue common to many IOCCC
entries.  And while some people prefer infrequent updates to a repo
the [IOCCC judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) believe
the ability to trace changes with commit messages is important.

Changes to the IOCCC content included things such as:

* Moving IOCCC entries into their own separate directories.
* Establishing a detailed manifest for an IOCCC winning entries.
* Fixing lots and lots of typos.
* Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to be
compiled with/in modern systems.
* Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to run
with/in modern systems.
* Reworking the Makefiles to use a consistent set of rules.
* Reworking the Makefiles specific to the gcc and clang C compilers.
* Replacing the various hint files with a index.html markdown (from README.md
files) that is more consistent across IOCCC years.
* Generating HTML content from markdown files and JSON data files via a [set of
tools and scripts](/bin/index.html).
* Setting up a system whereby authors of IOCCC entries may update their own
contact information via a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls).
* Setting up to generate the top level [years.html](/years.html) file via the
[gen-years.sh](/bin/gen-years.sh) tool.
* Setting up to generate the top level [authors.html file](/authors.html), renamed
from `winners.html`, via the [gen-authors.sh](/bin/gen-authors.sh) tool.
* Making use of a new and improved [IOCCC CSS](/ioccc.css) for web site consistency
* Etc.

## <a name="faq2"></a>Section 2: IOCCC Judging process


### <a name="faq2_0"></a>FAQ 2.0: How many entries do the judges receive for a given IOCCC?

By tradition, we do not say.


### <a name="faq2_1"></a>FAQ 2.1: What should I put in the remarks.md file of my entry?

While you may put in as much or as little as you wish into your entry's
`remarks.md` file, we do have few important suggestions:

We recommend that you explain how to use your entry.  Explain the
command line (if any command line options and arguments are used)
and any input or actions if applicable.

We highly recommend that you explain why you think your entry is
well obfuscated.

For those entries that win the IOCCC, we often use much of text from the
`remarks.md` file in the _Author's remarks_ section of the `index.html` file.
For this reason, a well written `remarks.md` file is considered a plus.

While not required, consider adding bit of humor to your `remarks.md`
as most people who are not humor impaired, as well as the IOCCC judges
appreciate the opportunity for a fun read as well as a chuckle or two.


#### What helps:

- explaining what your entry does
- how to entice it to do what it is supposed to do
- what obfuscations are used
- what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability and/or input data
- how it works (if you are really condescending)


#### What does not help:

- admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest is
called the **IOCCC**, not the **INVOCCC** :-) ); but even if you do not admit
it, not very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win (although
[2000/tomx](years.html#2000_tomx) is a notable counterexample).
- mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section (or
in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the judging
rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry wins. See the guidelines if
this is not clear!
- leaving the remark section empty.


### <a name="faq2_2"></a>FAQ 2.2: Why don't you publish entries that do not win?

Because the publication on the IOCCC site **_IS_** the award!
Anyone is free to put their IOCCC hopefuls, lookalikes and/or
entries that do not win on their web page for everyone to see.


### <a name="faq2_3"></a>FAQ 2.3: How much time does it take to judge the contest?

It takes a fair amount of time to setup, run, answer email, process entries,
review entries, trim down the set entries to a set of winning entries, doing the
write-up of the entries, announcing the entries, reviewing final edits of the
winning entry set, posting the winning entries, being flamed :-), tell folks who send in
late entries to wait until the next contest, etc... It takes a few weekends and
a number nights of study and work ... which is hard given that we are busy with
many other activities as well.

Note that we do not contact the author if an entry does not compile or does not
work as advertised, we might attempt to fix obvious compilation problems or
incompatibilities, but no more than that - so be sure that your entry does work
on at least a couple different platforms, at least one of them being UNIX or
POSIX-conforming.


### <a name="faq2_4"></a>FAQ 2.4: How many judging rounds do you have?

Are you trying to trick us? :-)

By tradition, we do not say how many judging rounds we have in a given IOCCC.

We often report when the IOCCC judges start the 1st round, and
when usually report when the IOCCC judges start near final judging rounds, and
sometimes we also report when we enter what we believe is the final judging round, so you may guess that we have at least 3 rounds.  :-)  The actual number of rounds is certainly more than 3.


### <a name="faq2_5"></a>FAQ 2.5: Why do some IOCCC entries receive the Grand Prize or Best of Show award?

In some years, the IOCCC judges discover a truly amazing IOCCC entry that
stands out among all of the other IOCCC entries received that year.
For such an IOCCC entry, the IOCCC judges award a "Grand Prize"
or "Best of Show award.

In 1984-1987, the grand prize winning entries are:

- [1984/mullender](years.html#1984_mullender)
- [1985/shapiro](years.html#1985_shapiro)
- [1986/wall](years.html#1986_wall)
- [1987/lievaart](years.html#1987_lievaart)

Starting from 1988, the entry we liked the most in that year is called
"Best of Show". Here are the "Best of Show" entries:

- [1988/applin](years.html#1988_applin)
- [1989/jar.2](years.html#1989_jar.2)
- [1990/theorem](years.html#1990_theorem)
- [1991/brnstnd](years.html#1991_brnstnd)
- [1992/vern](years.html#1992_vern)
- [1996/august](years.html#1996_august)
- [1998/banks](years.html#1998_banks)
- [2000/jarijyrki](years.html#2000_jarijyrki)
- [2020/carlini](years.html#2020_carlini)


In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the judges were unable to select a clear overall
winning entry. So to give a nod to the entry that had the highest approval ranking
from the judges, they used the following awards:

- [1993/rince](years.html#1993_rince) - Most Well Rounded
- [1994/shapiro](years.html#1994_shapiro) - Most Well Rounded
- [1995/leo](years.html#1995_leo) - Best Use of Obfuscation

These could be considered the 'best entry' for those years with 1 or
more other entries that came in close behind.


### <a name="faq2_6"></a>FAQ 2.6: How are IOCCC entries announced?

Once the [IOCCC](../index.html) closes, the judges will:

* Select the [winning entries](../years.html) announce them on the [@IOCCC
mastodon feed](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc).

* Notify the authors of entries that won the IOCCC via email using their previously
registered email address.

* Announce who are authors of this year's winning IOCCC entries via the [@IOCCC mastodon
feed](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc).

* Upload the winning code to the [Official IOCCC winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner)

* Update the [Official IOCCC web site](../index.html), and in particular
display this year's winning IOCCC entries at the top of the [IOCCC
winning entries page](../years.html).

* Update the [IOCCC news](../news.html) page.


## <a name="faq3"></a>Section 3: Compiling and running IOCCC entries


### <a name="faq3_0"></a>FAQ 3.0: What Makefile rules are available to build or clean up IOCCC entries?

In general the best way to compile everything in an entry directory is to run:

```sh
    make clobber all
```

If you wish to compile every entry for every year you should go to the top level
directory and run the same command as above, `make clobber all`.

The `all` rule will build everything necessary except for the alternate
versions. Every Makefile has an `alt` rule but it will only do something if an
alternate version exists. To build all the entries along with any alternate code
you can do from the top level directory:

```
    make clobber everything
```

If you wish to only build alternate code you can do:

```sh
    make clobber alt
```

If you wish to not remove the entry binaries and only compile the additional alt
versions:

```sh
    make alt
```

The following Makefile rules should be in all Makefiles:

- all: build the entry programs (main program and any supplementary program)
- alt: build alternate code
- clobber: clean up object files and all binary files (except for those that are
not compiled)
- clean: a simpler version of `clobber` that only removes object files. `make
clobber` depends on `clean` so running `make clobber` will invoke `make clean`.
- everything: equivalent to `make all alt`.

Are there any other rules? You tell us!

NOTE about the above rules: the Makefile default assumes `cc` which might be a
gcc-based compiler, or a clang-based compiler, or some other compiler. Only by
forcing `CC=clang` or `CC=gcc` will one invoke a specific compiler to, say,
enable or disable additional warnings or flags. Even so different versions or
compilers might do different things, have different defects or other issues.


### <a name="faq3_1"></a>FAQ 3.1: Why doesn't this IOCCC entry compile?

Some entries that won the IOCCC, particularly entries from long ago, no longer compile on more
modern systems because the C language has evolved (i.e. the modern C compilers
are much more strict in what they accept as a valid program), or the entry
depended on operation system and library features that where common back then
but are different/missing today.

Please see the other FAQs in this section as they might offer helpful
hints, especially in cases were something else needs to be installed.

Please see the [bugs.html](bugs.html) file for details about known problems with IOCCC entries.  In some cases you may be dealing with a problematic entry.  In a few fun cases, the IOCCC does not compile by design!

If you have a fix that makes a minimal impact to the entry, then
please consider submitting that change in the form of a pull request.
Please see [FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry](#fix_an_entry).  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.

In some cases alternative code has been added that does compile on some or most systems.  Check the write up for the entry for "alt" code and possible ways to compile and run that code.  In some cases we replaced the original code (but not the `.orig.c` file!) with code
that works for modern systems but one can view the original code in the
`.orig.c` files (sometimes the original code is also in the directory as a
`dirname.alt.c` or `prog.alt.c`).


### <a name="faq3_2"></a>FAQ 3.2: Why does a IOCCC entry fail on my 64-bit system?

Unfortunately some older entries are non-portable and require 32-bit support or
32-bit binaries. A problem system here is macOS Catalina (10.15) as as of that
version macOS no longer supports 32-bit binaries. If the entry acts on a certain
type of binary, say ELF, then that will also be a problem depending on the
entry. For example [2001/anonymous](2001/anonymous/index.html) requires 32-bit
ELF binaries.

There are numerous example entries that require 32-bit binaries. We have tried
to note these in both the respective Makefiles and index.html files but it is
possible that some were missed. These entries are very likely in the
[bugs.html](bugs.html) file and we welcome any help in making an alternate version
for 64-bit systems. Many were fixed to work with modern systems but some are
supposed to only work with 32-bit systems so any updated version of these
entries should be an alternate version.

Other entries like [2001/herrmann2](thanks-for-help.html#2001_herrmann2)
now work with 32-bit AND 64-bit systems.

Please see the [bugs.html](bugs.html) file for the problematic entry
in question to see if the problem is known, and if a fix is wanted,
consider trying to port the code to a 64-bit system and submitting
a pull request with that change.  Pull requests that fix such code
while trying to minimize the impact of any changes and preserving
the spirit of the original code are very welcome!  Please see [FAQ
5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC entry](#fix_an_entry) for
details.  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone make a change to
a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull request](#ull_request)
for more information about pull requests.


### <a name="faq3_3"></a>FAQ 3.3: Why do some IOCCC entries fail to compile under macOS?

If the entry requires gcc and you did not explicitly install gcc in macOS you
will not be able to run or use these entries. This is because macOS gcc is
actually clang, even `/usr/bin/gcc`.

That being said many (if not most) of these entries have been fixed and some
others will be looked at, when found.

In some cases the [bugs.html](bugs.html) file may note a known macOS problem
with an entry.  Should you manage to port the entry, and assuming your changes
also attempt to preserve the original intent of the IOCCC entry, we would
encourage you to submit a pull request with your ported code.
Please see FAQ 5.2 <a href="#fix_an_entry">"How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry"</a> for details.


### <a name="faq3_4"></a>FAQ 3.4: Why does clang or gcc fail to compile an IOCCC entry?

Although we have fixed numerous entries to work with clang (sometimes in an alt
version but usually in the program itself) there are some that simply cannot be
fixed or if they are fixable they have not yet been fixed (we are working on
this but other things have to be done too and all on free time).

This is because clang has some defects where the args of main() are required to
be a specific type and some versions of clang allow only 1, 2 or 3 args, not 4,
to main(). In the case of types of args many were changed to the right type and
then what was main() became another function of the original main() type.

At the same time some entries are not designed to work with clang. There might
be alternate code added at some point but as above this depends on free time and
other things that have to be done plus remembering to do it.

See if the problem is mentioned in [bugs.html](bugs.html).  If you have a change
that fixes the problem (even if it just a change to the `Makefile`) that doesn't
negatively impact the entry too much, consider submitting that change in the
form of a pull request.  Please see [FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry](#fix_an_entry).  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.


### <a name="faq3_5"></a>FAQ 3.5: What is this cb tool that is mentioned in the IOCCC?

This was a C beautifier for Unix, both AT&T and Berkeley, but it seems to no
longer be available, code wise, except for Plan 9, but Plan 9 was never used for
judging the IOCCC. A Unix man page for `cb`
[still exists](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-cb-command).


### <a name="faq3_6"></a>FAQ 3.6: An IOCCC entry messed up my terminal application, how do I fix this?

The simplest way to do this is to type `reset`. If echo was disabled you can get
usually away with `stty echo`. Sometimes you can also get away with `stty sane`.
`reset` does the most but note that it will clear the screen (obviously `clear`
will too but it won't reset the terminal).


### <a name="faq3_7"></a><a name="X11macos"></a><a name="X11"></a>FAQ 3.7: How do I run an IOCCC entry that requires X11?


#### <a name="X11_general"></a>Generally, to compile and run an IOCCC entry that requires X11:

You must have the X11 related include files and X11 libraries in order to
compile the IOCCC entry. In order to do this you will need to install Xorg and
related packages including development related packages. If you have macOS see
further down for different instructions. Otherwise: in particular you must:

* Install the Xorg server.
* Configure the Xorg server for your graphics environment.
* Install a X11 terminal application.
* Start the Xorg server.
* Launch the X11 terminal application.
* Run the IOCCC entry in the X11 terminal application.

By X11 terminal application we suggest one of:

* [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org) terminal application
* [KDE](https://kde.org) terminal application
* `xterm(`) terminal application

See below for various system related hints that may be of help.


#### <a name="Xorg_deprecated"></a>X.org server has been deprecated

The Red Hat RHEL9.0 release notes state that [X.org Server is now
deprecated](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_graphics-infrastructures).

According to this [Linux for Devices tutorial on
XOrg](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/install-xorg-on-linux) as
of 2023 Mar 25:


> Recently, RHEL developers categorized [Xorg was put in the ‘deprecated’
software](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality),
as its development has mostly halted. Subsequent updates will completely replace
it with Wayland, a more modern windowing system.. Although Wayland is not fully
developed yet, many applications do not support it properly yet and screen
sharing might not work sometime, but it is the future. Fedora, also developed by
RHEL, has switched to a Wayland session as it’s default windowing system (And it
works flawlessly on my Laptop).

See the [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) web site for more details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: We do **NOT** know if IOCCC entries will run under
**Wayland**.  Some IOCCC entries that use X11 might be OK while other IOCCC
entries that use X11 in an unusual way might fail under **Wayland**.


See the [Wayland FAQ](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html) for more
information.

If your system uses **Wayland** and not X11, you might give the IOCCC entries
that use X11 a try.  They might work but again we do not know.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The [IOCCC judges](judges.html) [do not support IOCCC entries](#no_support).
So if an IOCCC entry that uses X11 fails under **Wayland**, and you wish to
provide a fix to the IOCCC entry so that it will run under **Wayland**,
then consider [submitting a fix](#fix_an_entry) so that it will run under **Wayland**.

Basically: if you discover an entry does not work in Wayland you are welcome to
provide **alternate code** that works for Wayland. We will happily credit you in
the [thanks-for-help.html](thanks-for-help.html) file.


#### Red Hat based Linux

First, see the above note on [installing and starting Xorg](#X11_general).

Install Xorg and related packages:

```sh
    sudo dnf install --skip-broken --best --exclude xorgxrdp --exclude xorgxrdp-glamor '*xorg*' 'libx*' 'libX*' 'fontconfig*'
```

See also:

* [How to Configure X11 in Linux](https://www.wikihow.com/Configure-X11-in-Linux)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The [X.org server has been deprecated](#Xorg_deprecated).
See the above note for details.


#### macOS

First, see the above note on [installing and starting Xorg](#X11_general).
However, for macOS, instead of installing the Xorg server, you need to install and launch
the [most recent XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) application
and then run the IOCCC entry from the [Xterm window
shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm).

As an example we will use [1993/jonth](1993/jonth/index.html) which works
with macOS 14.2.1 (macOS Sonoma).

First of all you will need to install the [most recent
XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org), preferably on an [Apple supported version of
macOS, preferably the most recent version](https://support.apple.com/macos).
After it is installed, open the "XQuartz" application (usually located in
`/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app`) by typing at the command line:

```sh
    open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app
```

With the "XQuartz" application open you will get an [X Window System
Manager](https://www.x.org/wiki/) launched with an [Xterm window
shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm) started:

<img alt="xterm-launch in macOS" src="png/xquartz-shell.png">

At this point you need to cd to the winning directory and compile it. For example:

<img alt="compiling an entry in xterm in macOS" src="png/xquartz-entry-compile.png">

And then run the program as directed by the `index.html` file. For example with
`1993/jonth`:

<img alt="running 1993/jonth in macOS" src="png/xquartz-1993-jonth.png">

Note that you can compile the code in your regular terminal prior to opening
XQuartz, should you wish to. You can even run it from that terminal and it
should open XQuartz.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The [X.org server has been deprecated](#Xorg_deprecated).
See the above note for details.


#### Debian based Linux

First, see the above note on [installing and starting Xorg](#X11_general).

According to the [Debian Xorg wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Xorg), installing
X11 requires:

```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The [X.org server has been deprecated](#Xorg_deprecated).
See the above note for details.


#### Other Linux distributions

First, see the above note on [installing and starting Xorg](#X11_general).

### <a name="faq3_8"></a><a name="SDL"></a>FAQ 3.8: How do I compile an IOCCC entry that requires SDL1 or SDL2?

This depends on your operating system but below are instructions for Linux and
macOS with alternative methods for macOS and different package managers with Linux.


#### Red Hat based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    dnf install SDL2 SDL2-devel sdl12-compat sdl12-compat-devel
```

Older RHEL distributions might have to use "yum" instead of "dnf"
in the above command.

In the past it was said that one might need to run `make` like:

```sh
    make ... SDL2_INCLUDE_ROOT=/usr
```

or set the following environment variable:

```sh
    export SDL2_INCLUDE_ROOT=/usr
```

but this might not be necessary in more modern days especially as we use
`sdl-config` and `sdl2-config` which should find the proper paths.


#### macOS

If you're using macOS there are at least three ways to obtain it. You can
use Homebrew or MacPorts.  If you do not wish to use either of those
package managers, you can always try to install via the package website.
For macOS we do recommend using Homebrew or MacPorts instead of using
the package website.


##### macOS via Homebrew

If you have not already done so, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Then to install SDL and SDL2, execute the following command:

```sh
    brew install sdl2 sdl12-compat
    eval "$(opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```


##### macos via MacPorts

If you haven't already, install
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). Then run:


```sh
    sudo port install libsdl libsdl2
```


#### Debian based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    apt install libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libsdl2-dev
```

and then try `make all` again.

In the past it was said that one might need to run `make` like:

```sh
    make ... SDL2_INCLUDE_ROOT=/usr
```

or set the following environment variable:

```sh
    export SDL2_INCLUDE_ROOT=/usr
```

but this might not be necessary in more modern days especially as we use
`sdl-config` and `sdl2-config` which should find the proper paths.


#### Other Linux distributions

Use your package manager to install the appropriate packages. Try the search
feature of the package manager to determine which packages you need to install.
Note that you might have to install both the library and the developmental
packages: one for compiling and one for linking / running.


#### package website

Go to the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org) and follow their instructions
for downloading, installing and using SDL.

We recommend trying a method suitable for your environment first, if possible.


#### NOTE: there might be extra SDL packages required

In the case that some entries do not work even with SDL1/SDL2 installed it might
be that you need additional SDL libraries. See the entry's index.html for
details. If something is not noted you're welcome to report it as an issue or
fix it and make a new pull request.

See the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone make a change to a file and submit that change
as a GitHub pull request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.


### <a name="faq3_9"></a><a name="curses"></a>FAQ 3.9: How do I compile an IOCCC entry that requires (n)curses?

This depends on your operating system but below are instructions for Linux and
macOS with alternative methods for macOS and different package managers with Linux.


#### Red Hat based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    dnf install ncurses ncurses-devel
```


#### macOS

With macOS it should already be installed. If it is not you might have to do:

```sh
    xcode-select --install
```

and agree to the terms and conditions and proceed with the install.


##### macOS via Homebrew

Not applicable, see above.


##### macos via MacPorts

Not applicable, see above.


#### Debian based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    apt install libncurses6
```

and then try `make all` again.


#### Other Linux distributions

Use your package manager to install the appropriate packages. Try the search
feature of the package manager to determine which packages you need to install.
Note that you might have to install both the library and the developmental
packages: one for compiling and one for linking / running.


#### package website

Go to the [ncurses website](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) and follow their instructions
for downloading, installing and using ncurses.

We recommend trying a method suitable for your environment first, if possible.


### <a name="faq3_10"></a><a name="sox"></a>FAQ 3.10: How do I compile and use an IOCCC entry that requires sound?

This might depend on the entry but most likely the Swiss Army Knife of sound
processing programs, [SoX](https://sox.sourceforge.net), will work. How to
install depends on your OS.

#### Red Hat based Linux

As root or via sudo:

```sh
    dnf install -y sox sox-devel
```

#### macOS

For macOS there are two well known options.

##### macOS via Homebrew

If you have not already done so, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Then to install SoX, execute the following command:

```sh
    brew install sox
    eval "$(opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```


##### macOS via MacPorts

If you haven't already, install
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php). Then run:


```sh
    sudo port install sox
```


#### Debian based Linux

Usually the index.html file will explain how to use it under Debian so we do not
include this here, at least for now.


#### package website

Not applicable, see above.


#### Other Linux distributions

### <a name="faq3_11"></a>FAQ 3.11: Why do Makefiles use -Weverything with clang?

While we know that use of `-Weverything` is generally not recommended
by `clang` C compiler developers, we do use the `-Weverything`
option in a certain case in IOCCC entry `Makefile`s.

The use of `-Weverything` is limited to when one forces `CC=clang` or more
generally if the string 'clang' is in `$(CC)`. If `$(CC)` contains 'gcc' the
'gcc' specific options are run instead.

Users with clang compilers are not required to set `CC=clang` or equivalent but
when they do, `-Weverything` is enabled with all of its challenges, pedantic
warnings, and sometimes warnings about things that do not matter, some of which
are frankly frivolous and often downright dubious.

To enable this feature:

```sh
    make clobber all CC=clang
```

or:

```sh
    make clobber all 'CWARN+= -Weverything'
```

though it should be noted that if one tries `-Weverything` with compilers that
are not `clang` they _might_ see something like:

```sh
    echo 'int main(void) {}' > foo.c ; cc -Weverything foo.c -o foo
    cc: error: unrecognized command-line option '-Weverything'
```

which means that it can't even be compiled. Thus the proper way to do it is the
first way, `make clobber all CC=clang`.

IOCCC authors who have access to `clang` might wish to try their
hand at compiling with `-Weverything` while using a minimum of `-Wno-foo`
statements.  Sometimes there is a technical or pedantic issue that
`-Weverything` warns about that would merit a change to your C code; often,
however, it is not even possible to fix let alone is it worth it. Of course
if you're running out of bytes due to rule 2[ab] one might not have much choice.
This is something that obfuscation authors simply sometimes have to deal with!

If you try to minimize the number of `-Wno-foo` options needed with
`-Weverything`, please mention this in your remarks about the entry, as the
judges note you attempt to honor it (see also below). In some cases your
obfuscated code will issue warnings with `-Weverything` no matter what: the
`-Wno-poison-system-directories` is a common example of this but there are
others as well, sometimes depending on the version of `clang`.

If you do try for a compile with `clang -Weverything`, keep on mind that while _your_
compile environment might be warning free, a different clang version or a
different build environment might still have warnings. For instance the warning
set is different in macOS (which by default is `clang`: even when run as `gcc`!)
than Linux (due to versions and possibly other things)!

Given that your entry **MUST** work as documented, you may be safer to
say that your entry keeps the number of warnings and `-Wno-foo` options while
compiling with `clang -Weverything` at a minimum. You might want to say the
version number and platform too as an extra safety net. Because if you claim zero
warnings, and we find a warning situation, this may diminish the value of your
entry as it is not as documented. Thus it might be wise to point this out and
if you can test it in multiple platforms (or versions of `clang`, see
below note) this would be advisable.

NOTE: different versions of `clang` have other differences as well. For instance
a defect of `clang` that required numerous entries to be fixed for clang is that it
requires that `main()`'s arguments to be of a specific type. However some
versions of `clang` are more strict in the number of args allowed. These reasons
are part of why numerous entries had to be modified so that `main()` calls
another function instead of doing it all in `main()` (another reason was that
some entries that recursively called `main()` caused a crash or otherwise broke
the entry in modern systems). Some entries do not work in `clang` (or at least do
not work completely) due to these defects, for instance
[1989/westley](1989/westley/index.html); [Cody Boone
Ferguson](../authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) was able to
get much of it to work and looking at that entry might be of value to your
submissions, at least if you can figure the code out :-). To see the
differences, try from `1989/westley`:

```sh
    make diff_orig_prog
```

If you have `colordiff` try:

```sh
    make DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog
```

Alternatively you can try:

```sh
    git diff d2a42f42e8f477f29e9d5ed09ce2bb349eaf7397..eb9e69fde657acc8c85a618a8a99af4c2f93b21d westley.c
```

As you can see, using `clang` has some additional problems to work out but if
you can get your entry to work well in `clang` it might very well be considered
better than other entries.


### <a name="faq3_12"></a>FAQ 3.12: How do I find out how to send interrupt/EOF etc. for entries that require it?

For some entries one needs to send interrupt or EOF or some other signal/other
special characters. There are typical defaults like (where `^` = ctrl):

- `^D` for EOF (`eof`)
- `^C` for interrupt (`intr`)
- `^U` for kill (`kill`)

and various others. But if you don't know this you can find out through the
`stty(1)` command with the `-a` option. For instance with macOS you might see:

```sh
    $ stty -a
    speed 9600 baud; rows 40; columns 155;
    intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; [..snip..]
```

If you know the name you can use `grep` to find the correct line and if your
implementation of `grep(1)` has the `-o` option you can filter it. For instance
to find what the `intr` is set to:

```sh
    $ stty -a |grep -o 'intr = ^[[:alpha:]]'
    intr = ^C
```

... assuming of course that it's a ctrl combination :-) If for some strange
reason it's not you might have to do something else including just piping it to
just `grep intr` or whatever.


### <a name="faq3_13"></a><a name="no_support"></a>FAQ 3.13: Why does an IOCCC entry fail to compile or or fail run?

What may have worked years ago may not work well or work at all today.
Please note that the IOCCC judges do **NOT** support IOCCC entries.
Nevertheless, there may be a number of reasons why an IOCCC entry
may fail to compile or run well or fail to run on your system.

In some cases the American National Standards Institute's ANSI C
committee has damaged the C standard to the point where perfectly
valid C programs no longer compile with modern compilers.  As such
some old IOCCC entries cannot no longer be compiled with modern compilers.

In some cases programs that may have worked on an old computer system
longer work on modern computers.  Some IOCCC entries do not work well,
or no longer work on modern computers or modern operating systems.
Some IOCCC entries fail to compile under clang, or gcc.
Some IOCCC entries require operating system services that
may not be present on your system.

In some cases the IOCCC entry simply has bugs or (Mis)features.

If you are having problems compiling or running an IOCCC entry,
we recommend that you look in [bugs.html](bugs.html) to see if
there is a known bugs or (Mis)feature.  In some cases what you
may think is a bug is actually an feature that was intentionally
written by the authors.  In some cases the problem is well
known and we are looking for someone to attempt to fix it.

In some cases there is an alternate version of the IOCCC entry
that you may wish to try.

It also possible that you may have discovered a bug in an winning IOCCC
entry.  If so, you are invited to try an fix the IOCCC entry and
submit that fix by way of a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls).
Please see [FAQ 5.2](#fix_an_entry) for how to submit a fix to an IOCCC entry.


### <a name="faq3_14"></a><a name="tcpserver"></a>FAQ 3.14 - How do I compile and install tcpserver for entries that require it?

If your OS package manager does not have the package `tcpserver` you can
download, making sure you're in a temporary directory, and compile the source
like:

```sh
    wget http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
    tar ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
    cd ucspi-tcp-0.88
    make
```

Then as root or via `sudo(1)` enter:

```sh
    make setup check

### <a name="faq3_18"></a><a name="OpenGL"></a>3.18 - How do I compile and install OpenGL for entries that require it?

This depends on your operating system for which we describe a couple below.

In general OpenGL needs X11 to be installed and the X Window Server to be running.
See [FAQ 3.7: How do I run an IOCCC entry that requires X11?](#X11_general) for
general information about X11.

Once X11 is install and the X Window Server is running, one needs to compile
and link with the two libraries, _GL_ and _GLU_:

```sh
    cc ... -lGL -lGLU -L _location-where-X11-libs-are-installed_ -lX11
```

NOTE: The OpenGL development effort is being manageed by [vulkan.org](https://vulkan.org).
We suggest you check out their resource for further information on OpenGL.


#### Red Hat based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    sudo dnf install glew-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_image-devel glm-devel freetype-devel
```

See [OpenGL Programming/Installation/Linux](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Installation/Linux) for details.

Older RHEL distributions might have to use "yum" instead of "dnf"

#### macOS

In the past, macOS has come with OpenGL pre-installed.  However as of macOS 10.14,
[OpenGL has been deprecated on macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/OpenGL-MacProgGuide/opengl_intro/opengl_intro.html) (in favor of Metal).

As long as Apple continues to ship OpenGL pre-installed and it works, you
should be able to go.  However in Apple drops support for OpenGL later on,
you might look to install OpenGL via Homebrew or MacPorts.


#### Debian based Linux

Execute the following as root or via sudo:

```sh
    sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libglm-dev libfreetype6-dev

## <a name="faq4"></a>Section 4: Changes made to IOCCC entries


### <a name="faq4_0"></a>FAQ 4.0: Why are some winning entry remarks incongruent with the winning IOCCC code?

It is very likely in this case that the code was fixed to work for modern
systems as part of the reworking of the website. If you have this problem in
some entries you should look at the original code as in `dirname.orig.c` or
`prog.orig.c`. `dirname` is the directory name. For instance, one of Landon's
favourite entries of all time is [1984/mullender](1984/mullender/index.html) and
the entry's dirname there would be `mullender`. Sometimes the original is in an alt
version like `dirname.alt.c` or `prog.alt.c`. In fact it is advisable to look at
the original code when reading the author's (and sometimes authors') remarks.


### <a name="faq4_1"></a><a name="gets"></a>FAQ 4.1: Why were some calls to the libc function `gets(3)` changed to use `fgets(3)`?

Some may wonder: "Doesn't this tamper with the entry too much?"

A fine line indeed has to be drawn here but it was decided that it is worth it
because of alarming warnings that can be displayed, in some systems at runtime
interspersed with the output of the program.

For instance in macOS the entry [1990/tbr](1990/tbr/index.html) would output the
warning in such a way that caused confusing output for the entry, looking like:

```sh
    $ ./tbr
    $ warning: this program uses gets(), which is unsafe.
    # nothing here, what to do?
```

In some cases changing the code to use `fgets()` is not so easy to fix and in
one case at least there is an alternate version that has the fix instead due to
a problem it creates (correct output but segfaults after the output in one of
the forms of input).

In some cases it is not possible to fix or at least it is highly unlikely and so
those have mainly not been touched except one that has had the buffer size
increased (which could be done for others that are not possible to change to
`fgets()` though this has not been done).

Some entries can be made to look almost identical to the original entry. For
instance the fix to [1988/reddy](1988/reddy/index.html) required only a single
`#define` be added.

In the future we, the judges, would prefer that entries use `fgets()` to prevent
these problems.

An annoying fact is that for '"compatibility" reasons' `fgets()` retains the
newline and `gets()` does not.  As the Unix version 7 man page used to say:

```
    BUGS

    The fgets(3) function retains the newline while gets(3) does not, all in the
    name of backward compatibility.
```

We're not sure how this is compatibility but either way it can cause a
problem and it is this that has complicated most of the fixes though again some
can look almost identical.



### <a name="faq4_2"></a><a name="what_changed"></a>FAQ 4.2: What was changed in an IOCCC entry source code?

We have set up make rules to easily do see what was changed in the winning IOCCC
entry source.  Using the `Makefile` in the entry directory, use
one of the following _make(1)_ rules:

The following `make` rules exist to make a difference:

* `make diff_orig_prog`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the _original_ source to the
    current source (that is `entry.orig.c` to `entry.c`).
* `make make diff_alt_orig`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the original
    code (that is `entry.alt.c` to `entry.orig.c`). If no alt code exists
    nothing will be shown.
* `make diff_alt_prog`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the entry as it
    stands (that is `entry.alt.c` to `entry.c`).
* `make diff_orig_alt`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the original code to the alt code
    (that is `entry.orig.c` to `entry.alt.c`).
* `make diff_prog_alt`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the entry to the alt code (that is
    `entry.c` to `entry.alt.c`).
* `make diff_prog_orig`:
    - This rule will show the diff of the entry to the original code (that is
    `entry.c` to `entry.orig.c`).

For instance one of Landon's all time favourite entries is
[1984/mullender](1984/mullender/index.html) so the file names would be:
`mullender.orig.c`, `mullender.alt.c` and `mullender.c`. For later years, it
would be instead `prog.orig.c`, `prog.alt.c` and `prog.c`.

Note that you might see something like:

```
    make: [Makefile:170: diff_orig_prog] Error 1 (ignored)
```

at the end of the output but this is completely normal if there are differences.

If the alt code is the same as the original, say with
[1984/anonymous](1984/anonymous/index.html), then naturally there is no point in
running the rule and the same applies for all the other rules but this system
allows for easily seeing the diffs.

As some examples we'll first look at one that has really long lines which
will make it harder to see what is different,
[2001/anonymous](2001/anonymous/index.html). What you would do is `cd
2001/anonymous` and then do:

```sh
    make diff_orig_prog
```

and then be really confused! :-)

But for an entry like [1991/dds](1991/dds/index.html), you can see the
differences much more easily. `1991/dds` is a good example where it's very
simple to see what is different as it's just a couple lines.

You might be quite surprised how little some entries had to be changed and at
the same time how much other entries had to be changed, often with quite complex
differences! In some cases if the line is rather long, like the above mentioned
one, it will be harder to see what changed but in other cases like
[1984/decot](1984/decot/index.html) or [1986/wall](1986/wall/index.html) it's a
lot easier.

Well, at least it's easier see the differences on a line-by-line basis but maybe
not what actually changed, especially since it's easier to know what was fixed
when you have compiler errors :-) (though there are, as noted, some examples
where it's quite easy to see the differences).

[1991/dds](1991/dds/index.html) is also a good example to see the alt difference
very easily. To do that `cd 1991/dds` and then do:

```sh
    make diff_alt_prog
```

and you'll see a single line changed and very simply.


#### Tip: if you have `colordiff` installed it's a lot easier to see the differences

To use these rules but provide a different `diff`, for instance `colordiff`,
just do:

```sh
    make DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog # for orig to prog diff
    make DIFF=colordiff diff_alt_prog # for alt to prog diff
```

Obviously if you want to view the alt code or the orig code you can just open
the files as described above.


### <a name="faq4_3"></a> FAQ 4.3  - Why do author remarks sometimes not match the source and/or why are there other inconsistencies with the original entry?

If the entry has been fixed for modern systems and this fix required
modification to the code then invariably there will be entries where the remarks
of the author or authors are inconsistent with the original code, the size of
the code might be against rule 2 and other kinds of inconsistencies might also
be there.

This is why we recommend that when you read the remarks, sometimes the judges'
remarks and always the author's or authors' remarks, you look at the original
code. When the entry source code is called `prog.c` the original code is in
`prog.orig.c`; otherwise it is `dirname.orig.c`. For instance one of Landon's all
time favourite entries is [1984/mullender](1984/mullender/index.html) and the
original code is in [mullender.orig.c](1984/mullender/mullender.orig.c). In
some cases, such as `1984/mullender`, the original code is the same as the code
as no changes were made (there is an alt version for systems that are not
VAX-11/PDP-11, however).

See also [FAQ 4.2: What was changed in an IOCCC entry source code?](#what_changed)


### <a name="faq4_4"></a>FAQ 4.4: What is the meaning of the file ending in .orig.c in IOCCC entries?

Due to the fact that the original code has sometimes had to change these files
are the original winning entry or as close to as possible to the original that
we can find.


## <a name="faq5"></a>Section 5: Updating or correcting IOCCC web site content


### <a name="faq5_0"></a><a name="how_to_help"></a>FAQ 5.0: How may I help the IOCCC?

### We welcome your help in fixing IOCCC entries

The [known bugs](bugs.html) file, order by IOCCC years, contains a
list of known bugs & (mis)features.  If you are looking for an IOCCC entry
to try and fix, this file is a good place to start.

See [FAQ 5.2](#fix_an_entry) for information on how to submit a fix to
an IOCCC entry.  Before you consider trying to fix an IOCCC winning entry,
please check the [known bugs](bugs.html) file for the IOCCC entry
in question.  Note that in several cases what you may have discovered,
while a (mis)feature is not considered a bug and should **not be fixed**.
In cases where the bug is known, the entry's [known bugs](bugs.html) file
section may offer you important fixing clues.

### We welcome your help on fixing the IOCCC web site


### <a name="faq5_1"></a><a name="report_bug"></a>FAQ 5.1: How do I report a bug in an IOCCC entry?

We do not 'maintain' the contest entries as such. The code is made available on an 'AS
IS' basis. If you have a FIX for an entry, we suggest that you submit your fixes in a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls) as we welcome pull requests that have a
minimal impact on the entry while improving the portability, functionality, and/or addressing known problems.

If you do submit a pull request, we ask that each pull request address just one IOCCC entry at a time.

Note that just because you have a fix does not mean it'll be accepted. This
might be because the author objects or it doesn't fit in some way or another. Of
course if the entry does not work we'll certainly be more inclined to accept the
fix. If it is accepted we'll be happy to credit you in the
[thanks](thanks-for-help.html) file. If you're a previous author of a winning IOCCC entry we will happily
link to your entries; if you're not we can link to your website if you wish.

Please see [FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry](#fix_an_entry) for information on how to submit a fix to an
IOCCC entry.  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone make a change
to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull request](#ull_request)
for more information about pull requests.


### <a name="faq5_2"></a><a name="fix_an_entry"></a>FAQ 5.2: How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC entry?

If you see a problem with an IOCCC entry, first check the [known bugs](bugs.html)
file.  In some cases what you might think of as a bug is instead a known
feature.  In some cases the bug is known, but no fix has ever been submitted.
In other cases you may have found a new problem.

If you do have a fix, and the [known bugs](bugs.html) file **does not recommend
against fixing it**, then please consider opening a [GitHub pull
request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) against the master
[branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the [ioccc-src/winner
repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

BTW: A **problem** is not limited to the code itself.  Fixing typos in files
such as "_index.html_" files, fixing issues in a "_Makefile_", or otherwise
correcting an IOCCC entry is **VERY MUCH WELCOME**!  Please use the same
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process against
the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches) of the
[ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

NOTE: some of the issues in the [bugs.html](bugs.html) file includes just missing
files and we welcome these too!

**Please also help us fix typos and / or otherwise improve the write-up** of how
IOCCC winning entries are presented!

In any event we will happily add you to the
[thanks](thanks-for-help.html) file for your help!

And of course, an IOCCC author may update their own entries
(metadata as well as source code and any extra files) by opening a
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls)
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)

Note that we're much more inclined to accept an author's fixes but the judges
have the final say in the matter.


### <a name="faq5_3"></a><a name="report_web_problem"></a>FAQ 5.3: How may I report an IOCCC web site problem?

If you discover a problem with the IOCCC web site that is related
to a particular IOCCC entry, please see [FAQ 5.1](#report_bug) for
information about reporting a bug in an IOCCC entry, and see [FAQ
5.2](#fix_an_entry) for information on how to submit a fix to an IOCCC entry.

If you discover a problem with the IOCCC web site (such as a broken link, which
may or may not be specific to a particular IOCCC entry) that is **not related
to a particular IOCCC entry**, the best way you can help is to submit a fix to
the IOCCC web site.  See [FAQ 5.4](#fix_web_site) for information on submitting fixes
to the IOCCC web site.

If you do not have a IOCCC web site fix, and just wish to report a
general IOCCC web site problem, we ask that you first look at the
[IOCCC issues](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues) to see
if the problem has already been reported.  If it has been reported,
feel free to add a comment to the issue.  If you do not find an it
has been reported, then fee free to open a [new IOCCC
issue](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues).


### <a name="faq5_4"></a><a name="fix_web_site"></a>FAQ 5.4: How may I submit a fix to the IOCCC web site?

For IOCCC web site problems that relate to a particular IOCCC entry, please
see [FAQ 5.2](#fix_an_entry) for information on how submit a fix to an IOCCC entry.

You may open a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls)
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner)

#### Some HTML files should NOT be directly modified

Nearly all HTML files on the [IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org)
are built from [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.
If you see lines containing:

```
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
    <!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! -->
    <!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! -->
    <!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! -->
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
```

This means that the file is generated by a tool from a [bin directory tool](bin/index.html).
You should **NOT** attempt to modify the file.

You may also find lines slightly below the above set that suggest another file to edit.
For example, in [contact.html](contact.html), one may read:

```
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
    <!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md -->
    <!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md -->
    <!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md -->
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
```

This means that you could consider editing the referenced markdown file
in your [IOCCC pull request](#pull_request).

Please see [FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry](#fix_an_entry).  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.

In some cases, the HTML file is **NOT** based on markdown content, but instead
came from JSON and other data files.  So instead of the above reference to a
markdown file, you will read:

```
    <!-- The main section of this web page came from JSON and other data files -->
    <!-- -->
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
    <!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh -->
    <!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh -->
    <!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh -->
    <!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -->
```

This means there is **NOT even a markdown file to edit**.  Instead one must
modify JSON files and/or change a [bin directory tool](bin/index.html).

If this happens, consider opening up an [IOCCC issue](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues)
and ask for help.  See [FAQ 5.3](#fix_an_entry) for information on opening up an IOCCC issue.


## <a name="faq5_5"></a><a name="fix_author"></a>FAQ 5.5: How may I correct or update IOCCC author information?

Authors of IOCCC winning entries are kept in JSON files of the form:

```
    author/author_handle.json
```

where _author_handle_ is an author handle.  See [FAQ 6.5](#author_handle) for more
information about an author handles.

The contents of these JSON files contain the best known information
about authors of IOCCC entries.  See [FAQ 6.6](#author_json) for information
about the contents of these JSON file and how they are used.

You may update IOCCC author information in a `author_handle.json` file
by opening a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls)
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

Please see [FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry](#fix_an_entry).  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.


## <a name="faq5_6"></a><a name="fix_link"></a>FAQ 5.6: What should I do if I find a broken or wrong web link?

We would appreciate if you try to fix the broken (the link goes nowhere) or wrong
(the link goes to something that clearly is not the original intent) web link.
If wish to fix such links, you may open a GitHub pull request as described in
[FAQ 5.4](#fix_web_site). In the case of dead links or invalid links it doesn't matter
if it's a specific winner or not; the procedure is the same: open a pull request
to fix the problem.  See also the [FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request](#ull_request) for more information about pull requests.

As far as how to find the updated link you can try using the [Internet Wayback
Machine](https://web.archive.org) and see if you can find the last non 4xx non
3xx page. Note, however, that just because it redirects, does not mean it's not
valuable.  Other times you might find it with a web search.

Some links were changed to more recent URLs by doing this exact
same thing.  Some links, while they were a valid web page, no longer
reach the intended web page (for example when the domain is sold
and the new domain owner's content no longer provides the content
that was originally intended .. and while the content of the web
page may be humorous to some, the original content may have literally
gone "up in smoke").

In cases where the original content is lost, try searching for it on
the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org).  When searching
look back for dates that are around the year of given IOCCC contest.
If you do find the original content in Internet archive history,
please consider submitting a change to replace the link accordingly.

If there is no alternative that you can find you might want to remove the link
instead by replacing the link with just phrase of text.  For example,
if the text in some `index.html` file was:

```
    See the [author's description of the program](https://example.com) for more information.
```

Assuming that the author's description cannot be found in the
[Internet Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) archive, then
replace that text with:

```
    See the **author's description of the program** (sorry the content is no longer available) for more information.
```

If you just wish to report the bad link issue, see [FAQ 5.3](#report_web_problem).


## <a name="faq6"></a>Section 6: Miscellaneous IOCCC


### <a name="faq6_0"></a>FAQ 6.0: How did an entry that breaks the size rule 2 win the IOCCC?

As entries have been fixed it is entirely possible that some of the entries no
longer fit within the year's size restrictions. Invariably the length of columns
and/or number of rows have also changed.

The `winner.orig.c` file contains the original source code that was
subjected to rule 2 of the given IOCCC.  You may also wish to see
the [/archive](archive) directory where you can find all the
original winning entries as compressed tar files for a given year.

In some cases the entry may have abused rule 2 and declared an
"abuse of the rules" (although now blatant abuse of the rules to
get around rule 2 size limits is discouraged).


### <a name="faq6_1"></a>FAQ 6.1: Is there a list of known bugs and misfeatures of IOCCC entries?

Yes! Please see [bugs.html](bugs.html) for a list of known bugs and/or issues of a
variety of kinds.

Note that just because an entry is not in the bugs file does not mean there is
not an issue and note that some issues are simply missing files, dead URL(s) or
something like that.


### <a name="faq6_2"></a>FAQ 6.2: May I mirror the IOCCC web site?

We are not accepting mirror requests at this time, sorry.  However you are free to fork the [IOCCC winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).  We do ask that your fork keep up to date with the latest changes when possible.


### <a name="faq6_3"></a>FAQ 6.3: May I use parts of the IOCCC in an article, book, newsletter, or instructional material?

While IOCCC judges look favorably on most requests to use IOCCC material,
we request that you ask the [IOCCC judges](judges.html) first.

Please send your request using the instructions on the [contacting
the IOCCC Judges](/contact.html) page.


### <a name="faq6_4"></a>FAQ 6.4: Why do you sometimes use the first person plural?

As a precedent for [first person
plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism), we may sight [Two-,
Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects in bcc in
3He](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.1442) and
the co-authorship of [F. D. C.
Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard) as well
as the [APS New Open Access
Initiative](https://journals.aps.org/2014/04/01/aps-announces-a-new-open-access-initiative).

The number of [IOCCC judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) has
always been "> 1" such that IOCCC judges often prefer to themselves
in the plural, sometimes [in the common
plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural), sometimes in the
[first person plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism), there
may be some who reject such a practice.  Therefore please consider
that when you believe that just one of the [IOCCC
judges](../judges.html) is in action, you may
consider that [F. D. C.
Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard) has been
consulted, agreed, and has authorized the statement thus allowing
the [in the common plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural)
to be used without offense.

And while some might claim that [F. D. C.
Willard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard) died in
1982, we suggest that the [Schrödinger's
cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat) superposition
may still be in effect and the 1982 [report of death was an
exaggeration](https://books.google.com/books?id=ms3tce7BgJsC&lpg=PA134&vq=%22the%20report%20of%20my%20death%20was%20an%20exaggeration%22&pg=PA134#v=onepage&q=%22the%20report%20of%20my%20death%20was%20an%20exaggeration%22&f=false).

p.s. Here is an image of F. D. C. Willard:

[F D C Willard](png/F.D.C.Willard.png)


### <a name="faq6_5"></a><a name="author_handle"></a>FAQ 6.5: What is an author handle?

An `author_handle` is string that refers to a given author and is unique to the
IOCCC.  Each author has exactly one `author_handle`.

For each `author_handle`, there will be a JSON file of the form:

```
    author/author_handle.json
```

See [FAQ 6.6](#author_json) for information about the contents of these JSON file and
how they are used.

Because the `author_handle` is used to form a JSON filename, the string must be
POSIX safe string plus the use of `+` (for technical reasons beyond this
answer).  In particular, the `author_handle` must be an ASCII string that
matches this regexp:

```re
    ^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z._+-]*$"
```

Default `author_handle`'s do not have multiple consecutive `_` (underscore)
characters.  Nevertheless, multiple consecutive `_` (underscore) characters are
allowed. Contest submitters who wish to override their default `author_handle` may do so.

The `author_handle` is derived from the name of the author.  While there is a
algorithm that maps the name of the author (which can contain any UTF-8
characters) into a default `author_handle` string, those who submit an entry to
the IOCCC are free to choose a different `author_handle` string if they so
desire.

An `author` who has won a previous IOCCC is encouraged to reuse their
`author_handle` so that new winning entries can be associated with the same
author.

For an anonymous `author`, their handle is one of these forms:

```
    Anonymous_year
```

or:

```
    Anonymous_year.digits
```


The latter form is in case there are more than one anonymous author in a given
year.

NOTE: even if the directory name is not `anonymous` the above rules apply as in
in the case of [2005/anon](2005/anon/anon.c).

Anonymous `author_handle`'s match this regexp:

```re
    Anonymous_[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][.0-9]*$
```

See [FAQ 5.5](#fix_author) for information about how to update
and/or correct IOCCC author information.


### <a name="faq6_6"></a><a name="author_json"></a>FAQ 6.6: What is a author_handle.json file and how are they used?

**TL:DR**: The contents of these JSON files contain the best known
information about authors of IOCCC entries and is used to help form
HTML files as well to contact an author.

The content of these JSON files are used by tools from a [bin directory tool](bin/index.html)
to help build HTML content for the [official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org).
For example, the `index.html` file for each IOCCC entry contains
selected information about the authors.  Tools from the [bin directory](bin/index.html)
use the content of these JSON files to generate the `index.html` files for each IOCCC
winning entry.

Moreover, should the [IOCCC judges](judges.html) need to
contact an authors of a IOCCC entry, they will consult the contents
of the author's JSON file for ways to contact them.

Each author of an IOCCC winning entry has their own `author_handle.json` file
of the form:

```
    author/author_handle.json
```

where _author_handle_ is an author handle.  See [FAQ 6.5](#author_handle) for more
information about an author handles.

#### author_handle.json JSON file contents

The syntax of a `author_handle.json` follows the _So-called JSON spec_.
See [json_index.html](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/jparse/json_index.html#so_called_json_spec)
for information on the _So-called JSON spec_.

A good way to understand the JSON file contents of a `author_handle.json` file
is to look at an example, the `author_handle.json` file for Yusuke Endoh:

```

```

As of _Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023_, the contents was as follows:

```json
    {
	"no_comment" : "mandatory comment: because comments were removed from the original JSON spec",
	"author_JSON_format_version" : "1.0 2023-06-10",

    }
```

We now will walk thru the above JSON document looking at various JSON members:


##### no_comment

``` json
    "no_comment" : "mandatory comment: because comments were removed from the original JSON spec",
```

Because the authors of the so-called JSON spec removed the ability to use comments in JSON
(for reason(s) that seem to be less than credible), the IOCCC mandates this _JSON member_
be present in all IOCCC related JSON files.

There **MUST** be one and only one `no_comment` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be the exact _JSON string_ as shown above.


##### author_JSON_format_version

```json
    "author_JSON_format_version" : "1.0 2023-06-10",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the format version of the `author_handle.json` JSON file.

There **MUST** be one and only one `author_JSON_format_version`
_JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST** be a _JSON string_.

This is **NOT** the version of the contents!  When updating an
`author_handle.json` JSON file, **DO NOT MODIFY author_JSON_format_version**!
As of _Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023_, the _JSON value_ **MUST** be _"1.0 2023-06-10"_.

The _author_JSON_format_version_ would only changed when the overall format
of the these files is modified: and then only those who maintain the
[official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org) would be the one to do this
in conjunction with changes to [bin directory tools](bin/index.html).


##### author_handle

```json
    "author_handle" : "Yusuke_Endoh",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the author handle of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `author_handle` _JSON member_
and the _JSON value_ **MUST** be a _JSON string_ that is also a value author handle.

See [FAQ 6.5](#author_handle) for more information about an author handles.

Normally the _author_handle_ _JSON value_ should **NOT** be changed
**unless there is a strong reason to do so**.  If the  _JSON value_
changes, then all of the `.entry.json` files for all of this authors
winning IOCCC entries should also be changed.  The _author_handle_
_JSON value_ must match the basename (without the leading path and
without the trailing `.json`) of the `author_handle.json` file.  So
a change of _author_handle_ _JSON value_ would also require the
`author_handle.json` file to also be renamed.


##### full_name

```json
    "full_name" : "Yusuke Endoh",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the full name of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `full_name` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_.

The full name of an author may use non-ASCII characters so long as the
full name is properly encoded as a _JSON string_.


##### sort_word

```json
    "sort_word" : "endoh",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the string that will be used to sort the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `sort_word` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_.  Moreover the string **MUST** be a lower case ASCII
alphanumeric string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter.

The _JSON value_ is used, for example, to place a reference to the author
in the `/authors.html` file.

Normally the `sort_word` _JSON member_ _JSON value_ is the last
name of the author, translated into lower case ASCII alphanumeric
string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter.  If the author
wishes to be found in the `/authors.html` file under a different
string, such as if they wish to be listed under their first name
or their username, then they may change this accordingly.


##### location_code

```json
    "location_code" : "JP",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the string that is the
[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table)
of the author's location or country.

There **MUST** be one and only one `location_code` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_.  Moreover the string **MUST** be 2 character UPPER case ASCII
alphabetic string that is **NOT** an Unassigned
[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table) value
(not a 2 character symbol with a gray background on that Wikipedia table)

The `soup/location` tool from the [mkiocccentry repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry),
when run without arguments, will print the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes that permitted, along with
the location name.

We use the term "location" (and not "country") because some of the
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes belong to locations that are not technically
a country, such as "Antarctica" or a User-assigned code.

If the author wishes to not specify a location, they should select **XX**.


##### email

```json
    "email" : "mame@ruby-lang.org",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the email address of the author, or is the value null.

There **MUST** be one and only one `email` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.

If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the email address is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "email" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### url

```json
    "url" : "https://mametter.hatenablog.com",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the URL of the author's home page.

There **MUST** be one and only one `url` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.

If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the URL is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "url" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### alt_url

```json
    "alt_url" : null,
```

This _JSON member_ holds an alternate or 2nd URL a home page for the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `url` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.

In some cases the author may wish to record a special URL for their IOCCC entry,
or a 2nd URL such as a work or school or personal home page.  For example,
Cody as of  _Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023_ used:

```json
    "alt_url" : "https://ioccc.xexyl.net",
```

If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the alternate URL is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "url" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### deprecated_twitter_handle

This _JSON member_ used to hold the twitter handle of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `deprecated_twitter_handle` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.

The IOCCC no longer is associated with twitter (or whatever someone chooses to call it),
and so the `deprecated_twitter_handle` is **no longer used**.  A _JSON value_ that is
not a _JSON null_ is kept for only historic reasons.  For example, Anthony C. Howe
once used:

```json
    "deprecated_twitter_handle" : "@SirWumpus",
```

If the author wishes to not specify an twitter handle, or if the twitter handle is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "deprecated_twitter_handle" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### mastodon

```json
    "mastodon" : "@mame@ruby.social",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the
[Mastodon social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_\(social_network\))
handle of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `mastodon` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.  The _JSON string_ just be a valid
Mastodon handle.  In particular is must start with an at sign (_@_), followed by the
Mastodon username, followed by a 2nd sign (_@_), followed by the Mastodon server instance
used by the author.

For more information in Mastodon, see the [Mastodon help](https://mastodon.help) guide.
See the "Mastodon Address" section of that page in particular.

The IOCCC Mastodon handle is:

```json
    @ioccc@fosstodon.org
```

The IOCCC uses the Mastodon social network for announcements such
as the opening and closing of a new IOCCC, changes to the IOCCC web
site, updates during the judging process, and when new IOCCC entries
are selected.  We recommend you follow us on Mastodon.

If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon handle, or if the Mastodon handle is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "mastodon" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### mastodon_url

```json
    "mastodon_url" : "https://ruby.social/@mame",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the URL of the author's Mastodon page.

There **MUST** be one and only one `mastodon_url` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.  The _JSON string_ just be a valid URL.
If the `mastodon` handle is a _JSON null_, them the `mastodon_url` **MUST** be a _JSON null_.
If the `mastodon` handle is a _JSON string_, then the `mastodon_url` **MUST** be a _JSON string_.

The `mastodon_url` is just a translation of the above mentioned [mastodon](#mastodon) handle.
For example, if the Mastodon handle is:

```
    @user@server.domain
```

Then the `mastodon_url` would be:

```
    https://server.domain/@user
```

If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon URL, or if the Mastodon URL is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "mastodon_url" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### github

```json
    "github" : "@mame",
```

This _JSON member_ holds the [GitHub](https://github.com) handle of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `github` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.  The `github` _JSON string_ **MUST**
start with an at sign (_@_) and **MUST** be a valid GitHub username.

The IOCCC uses GitHub to hold the [official winner repo of the IOCCC](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner),
and hosts [official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org) on GitHub pages.

The IOCCC GitHub handle is:

```
    @ioccc-src
```

If the author wishes to not specify an GitHub handle, or if the GitHub handle is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "github" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### affiliation

```json
    "affiliation" : null,
```

This _JSON member_ holds the affiliation of the author.

There **MUST** be one and only one `affiliation` _JSON member_ and the _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a _JSON string_ or it **MUST** be a _JSON null_.

An affiliation might be the name of a school, university, company, or organization.
It is recommended that the affiliation _JSON string_ be the formal affiliation name.
For example, the affiliation for the IOCCC would be:

```
    The International Obfuscared C Code Contest
```

If the author wishes to not specify an affiliation, or if the affiliation is
unknown, they should use the _JSON null_ as the _JSON value_ of this _JSON member_.
For example:

```json
    "affiliation" : null,
```

NOTE: The _JSON null_ is **NOT** enclosed in quotes!


##### winning_entry_set
##### entry_id

```json
    "winning_entry_set" : [
        { "entry_id" : "2012_endoh1" },
        { "entry_id" : "2012_endoh2" },
	{ "entry_id" : "2013_endoh1" },
    ...
	{ "entry_id" : "2020_endoh1" },
        { "entry_id" : "2020_endoh2" },
        { "entry_id" : "2020_endoh3" }
    ]
```

The `winning_entry_set` _JSON member_ holds _JSON array_ containing one or more `entry_id` _JSON member_s.

There **MUST** be one and only one `winning_entry_set` and the  _JSON value_ **MUST**
be a non-empty _JSON array_.  Each value in that _JSON array_ **MUST** must contain
a _JSON member_ whose _JSON name_ **MUST** be "_entry_id_" and those _JSON value_
is a valid entry ID.

Due to the nature of the  _So-called JSON spec_, the last value of the `winning_entry_set`
_JSON array_ cannot end in a comma (_,_).

See [FAQ 6.7](#author_json) for information about entry ids.

See [FAQ 5.5](#fix_author) for information about how to update
and/or correct IOCCC author information.


### <a name="faq6_7"></a><a name="author_json"></a>FAQ 6.7: What is a entry_id?

A `entry_id` is a string that identifies a winning entry of the IOCCC.

A `entry_id` is a 4-digit year, followed by an underscore, followed by a directory name.

For example, the `entry_id` associated with Cody Boone Ferguson's 2nd winning IOCCC entry
of 2020 is found under the following directory:

```
    2020/ferguson2
```

The `entry_id` for that winning entry is:

```
    2020_ferguson2
```


### <a name="faq6_8"></a>FAQ 6.8: What is the purpose of the .top, .year and .path files?

The [.top](.top) file resides at the top directory.  This file contains the complete list
of IOCCC years.

Under each IOCCC year. one will find a `.year` file.  These files contain directory paths from the top directory,
of the IOCCC entry directories for a given year.  For example, see the [1984/.year](.1984/.year) file.

Under each IOCCC entry directory, you will find a `.path` file.
These files contain the directory path from the top directory.
For example see [1984/anonymous/.path](1984/anonymous/.path).

The .top, .year and .path files are generated from the top level Makefile, by:

```sh
    make genpath
```


### <a name="faq6_9"></a><a name"terms"></a>FAQ 6.9: What is the current meaning of the IOCCC terms Author, Entry, and Submission?

The IOCCC is now attempting to use the following terms:

- Author

An _author_ is someone who has submitted an entry that has won the IOCCC.

An entry can have more than one authors.  A number of authors have submitted
entries that have won the IOCCC, sometimes in the same IOCCC contest year.

**An apology for being inconsistent**: In the past, the IOCCC used the term _winner_ to
refer to what is now an _author_.  In a number of historical cases,
such as old rules and old guidelines, terms such as _winner_ may still be
found.  Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old
names such as _winner_ when they should use _author_.  Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)

- Entry

An _entry_ is a submission that won the IOCCC.

An _entry_ has one or more _authors_.

An _entry_ includes all of the files needed to compile it,
plus sample input files, a `Makefile`, an `.entry.json` file
describing the entry, a compressed tarball containing all of
files in the entry, etc.  Under the IOCCC tree, an _entry_
that win the IOCCC in year _YYYY_ is located under the
directory `YYYY/entry`.

**An apology for being inconsistent**: In the past, the IOCCC used the term _winner_ to
refer to what is now an _entry_.  In a number of historical cases,
such as old rules and old guidelines, terms such as _winner_ may still be
found.  Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old
names such as _winner_ when they should use _entry_.  Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)

- Submission

A _submission_ is something given to the IOCCC judges
for consideration when the IOCCC is open.

When the IOCCC is open for submissions, those who register
to enter the IOCCC may use the [mkiocccentry tool](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry)
to package their code into a compressed tarball that may be
uploaded to the [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org).
This compressed tarball is formatted in such a way that
the IOCCC judges do not see who wrote the code.

A _submission_ that the IOCCC judges deem to have won the IOCCC
becomes an _entry_.  Only then do the IOCCC judges look into
the special JSON file to discover who the _author_(s) are.

**An apology for being inconsistent**: In the past, the IOCCC used the term _entry_ to
refer to what is now a _submission_.  In a number of historical cases,
such as old rules and old guidelines, terms such as _entry_ may still be
found.  Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old
names such as _entry_ when they should use _submission_.  Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)

### <a name="faq6_10"></a><a name="pull_request"></a>FAQ 6.10: How does someone make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull request?

First, if you do not already have a GitHub account or you have not installed an
ssh key to your account you must do so. For this we will assume you do not have
a GitHub account. For the steps following creating a GitHub account you will
have to be logged into your account.

To help you out here is a navigation menu in this FAQ entry:

- [Creating a GitHub account](#creating-a-github-account)
- [Installing an ssh key to GitHub](#installing-an-ssh-key)
- [Forking the temp-test-ioccc repo](#forking-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo)
- [Cloning the temp-test-ioccc repo](#cloning-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo)
- [Making changes, fixes etc.](#making-changes-fixes-etc)
- [Committing your changes](#committing-your-changes)
- [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request)
- [What to do after a merge](#what-to-do-after-a-merge)


#### Creating a GitHub account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click on 'Sign up'. Follow the
instructions. Once you've completed this task make sure you log in to GitHub.

#### Installing an ssh key to GitHub

Assuming you do not have an ssh key you should go to the command prompt and
type (if you already have one and are okay using it for GitHub you can use that
one):

```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "luser@example.com"
```

where `luser@example.com` is the email you want associated with your key.
Follow the instructions. It will tell you the key files.

Once you have an ssh key you need to go to your [account
settings](https://github.com/settings/profile). Once there, in the menu
on the left you should see the item _SSH and GPG keys_. Click that and then
click (on the right side) the button that says _New SSH key_. You will see that
you have to specify a title, the key type and the PUBLIC key. Put whatever title
you want and keep the key type as _Authentication Key_. Now you need to put the
PUBLIC key in.

If you used an rsa key the default file will likely be found in:
`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If you used a different algorithm the file name will be
different. For instance if you used `ed25519` the default PUBLIC key file would
be `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. If, like some people do, you have a separate key for
GitHub, it could be anything you wish, as long as it's in `~/.ssh`. For instance
it might be `~/.ssh/github.pub`.

Whatever the key file is, copy the contents and paste it into the GitHub field
labelled _Key_. Once you have done so click on _Add SSH key_.

#### Forking the temp-test-ioccc repo

Open in your browser the link:
<https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/fork>. You now should follow the
instructions in forking the repo.


#### Cloning the temp-test-ioccc repo

Once you have forked the repo you are ready to clone it to your system. For
instance Cody Boone Ferguson has the GitHub handle _xexyl_ so he would type in:

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc [target_dir]
```

Once that is completed you will need to change to that directory. The default
directory would be the name of the repo but if you specified a target directory
it will be that. For instance using the above example you might do:

```sh
    cd temp-test-ioccc
```

You're ready to make your changes now!


#### Making changes, fixes etc.

Here you must use your wits, knowledge, creativity and whatever else you have.
Let's say that Cody wants to update his file
[/2020/ferguson1/play.sh](2020/ferguson1/play.sh) script. He would open it in
his editor of choice (in his case vim) and make the changes. He would then make
sure (as there is a last updated date) to update the last updated date. For
instance he might add the following:

> BTW: did you know that some people believe in snake human hybrids? It's true! See
> http://www.macroevolution.net/snake-human-hybrids.html and have a laugh, shock
> or an exercise in sibilance!

Then, assuming that the date is 1 March 2024, he would update the line that
starts with `# Last updated: ` to refer to `01 March 2024` rather than what it
is now (at the time of writing this), `15 April 2023`.

But what if he wanted to add a file? He'd create the file and then type:

```sh
    git add foo
```

where _foo_ is the file to add.

When he's ready to make a commit he would need to create a new branch for the
pull request.

#### Committing your changes

First, as an aside, if this is your first pull request (which we assume is if you're
reading this :-) ) you need to make sure that you can push changes to GitHub
with your ssh key. To do this you need to do:

```sh
    ssh -T git@github.com
```

Cody would see:

> Hi xexyl! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now, assuming that the forked repo is
<https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc>, you'd type:


```sh
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:xexyl/temp-test-ioccc.git
```

Now you'd be ready to make your commits.

Before doing anything else, however, a new branch needs to be created.
Continuing the example above for
[2020/ferguson1/play.sh](2020/ferguson1/play.sh), it might be that:


```sh
    git checkout -B human-snakes
```

This would change the branch to the newly created branch `human-snakes` branch.
Now Cody could commit the changes:

```sh
    git commit play.sh # if specifying specific files
    git commit -a # if committing everything
```

He could also have done:

```sh
    git add play.sh
    git commit
```

In any case this would open an editor (in his case vim) to write a commit log.
It is recommended that the first line is <=51 chars and the next line is blank.
Then if necessary add a description for the log. For instance the above might
warrant the log:

```
    Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh

    Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
    script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.
```

Now a pull request has to be opened.


#### Opening a pull request

To do this depends on the branch name. Assuming the branch from above,
`human-snakes`, you would type:

```sh
    git push --set-upstream origin human-snakes
```

This might show:

```
    Enumerating objects: 9, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
    Delta compression using up to 10 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 739 bytes | 147.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 5 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), completed with 4 local objects.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for 'human-snakes' on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc/pull/new/human-snakes
    remote:
    To github.com:xexyl/temp-test-ioccc.git
     * [new branch]	human-snakes -> human-snakes
    branch 'human-snakes' set up to track 'origin/human-snakes'.
```

The link referred to above would then be opened to open a pull request. Just
follow the instructions at this point. If however it does not show a link it is
likely because the branch already exists in your GitHub account (for the repo).
In this case you can open the link:
<https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls> which might show something
like:

```
    xexyl:human-snakes had recent pushes 1 minute ago
```

and to the right of it you would see a button that says _Compare & pull request_
which you could click on. Do that and follow the instructions.

An important note is if you have more than one pull request opened it'll only
show the branch name as the summary. You should in that case copy paste the log
you put in into the website. For instance the line (on the website) _Add a
title_ could have:

> Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh

and then the text field that is labelled _Add a description_ would have:

> Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
> script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.

Once you've done this you should click on _Create pull request_.

IMPORTANT NOTE: although the [Judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) will
give more deference to the authors of edited entries the
[Judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) also retain the final editorial say
in the matter.


#### What to do after a merge

When the judges have merged the pull request you now need to make sure your fork
has the merge. To do this from the command line, assuming the fork in the above
example, you would type:

```sh
    git checkout master && git pull https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc.git master && git push origin master
```

This will merge your pull request to your fork.
