## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```

The author provided us with an unobfuscated version. There is also a version
that scans (**ONLY** scans) the string `https` as a starting point in case
anyone wishes to add support or come up with a pipeline to make it work, as many
websites no longer work with `http`. See [alternate code](#alternate-code)
below.


### Bugs and (Mis)features:

The current status of this entry is:

> **STATUS: INABIAF - please DO NOT fix**

For more detailed information see [2005/mynx in bugs.html](../../bugs.html#2005_mynx).


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./mynx http://<domain>
```

You can specify a port by appending to the domain `:port`. See notes below on
the issue of https.


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./mynx http://www.textfiles.com

    ./mynx manual.html
```


## Alternate code:

The author's provided unobfuscated code,
[mynx.alt.c](%%REPO_URL%%/2005/mynx/mynx.alt.c) can be compiled and evaluated if
you wish to not try and decipher the original entry.

The other version, [mynx.alt2.c](%%REPO_URL%%/2005/mynx/mynx.alt2.c) is a
starting point for anyone who wishes to come up with a version (or pipeline)
that works with `https`.

Obviously this will not work with `https` without so easily as it only scans for `http` in the URL
(if not specified it tries to open it as a local file). But even though it scans
for `https` one would need to do more work as it would have to set up a secure
connection before http commands could be sent.  Fortunately or unfortunately
many more websites use https so this entry will not work as well as it used to.
If one were to try and connect to <https://ioccc.org> with this entry they'll
just get a 301 error.

This alternate code is a starting point that scans for `https` too (note you
have to specify the port in this case) but that is all it does. It will not work
with https websites as it stands as it does not set up a secure connection. But
should anyone wish to either come up with a pipeline (or some other command
line) that allows it to work with https or to update the code to support https
they may. Otherwise you must just appreciate the entry for what it once was.


### Alternate build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `mynx.alt` as you would `mynx`.

For the version that also scans for `https` you'll have to specify a port at the
end of the URL like:


``` <!---sh-->
    ./mynx.alt2 https://www.ioccc.org:443
```

but again unless you have a clever workaround or hack to the problem, this sadly
won't work.


## Judges' remarks:

This little `mynx` will give any [Fiery
Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) a run for its money. A nice
complement to last years winning [2004/hibachi](../../2004/hibachi/index.html). The
judges double dare any eager Obfuscationalists to submit the missing pieces to
get a functioning LAMP stack.


## Author's remarks:

I was rather impressed by last year's mini webserver. So much so that
it inspired me to try my hand at writing the client side complement.

A typical build command would be:

``` <!---sh-->
    cc -o mynx mynx.c
```

While some others like to be a little different:

``` <!---sh-->
    cc -o mynx mynx.c -lnsl -lsocket
```

I even managed to figure out a basic configure script, given last year's
example, which is kinda of useful when you consider how many OSes put
all the network functions in a variety of places. So a simpler build
command sequence would be:

``` <!---sh-->
    cd source ; ./configure ; make
```

After which, the rest of the documentation can be read by saying:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./mynx ../manual.html
```
