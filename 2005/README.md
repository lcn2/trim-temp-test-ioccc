# Eighteenth International Obfuscated C Code Contest


## Standard IOCCC stuff

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile the entry and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

The IOCCC has a web site and now has a number of international mirrors.
The primary site can be found at <https://www.ioccc.org/>.

Use `make(1)` to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Unix / non-Linux
systems the `Makefile` needs to be changed.  See the `Makefile` for details.

This year we included most of the information included by the submitters
in the `README.md` files (that were used to build the `index.html` web pages).

Read over the `Makefile` for compile/build issues.  Your system may require
certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a `#define`).

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using `gcc` instead of your
local compiler.


## Remarks on some of the entries

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winning entries.

In particular:

+ The [Abuse of the rules - 2005/klausler](klausler/index.html) used local dictionary data to
get around the size limit.

+ The [Most beauteous visuals - 2005/vince](vince/index.html) made clever use of `{}`s and
whitespace in their source code and during execution.

+ The [Most circuitous walk - 2005/vik](vik/index.html) entry is just amazing.

+ The [Best game - 2005/toledo](toledo/index.html) makes full use of its single function.

+ The [Best emulator - 2005/sykes](sykes/index.html) may allow you to reconnect to your first
[PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET).

+ Our [Best of Show - 2005/persano](persano/index.html) this year was simply (or non-simply :-) ) the best!

+ (And we need only mention (parenthetically speaking) that the [Best use of
parenthesis](mikeash/index.html) is self reproducing).

+ The [Most sonorous output - 2005/jetro](jetro/index.html) might `sound` :-) like a good idea.

+ The [Best 2D puzzle - 2005/giljade](giljade/index.html) takes editorial license with expressions as well as the
with the [vi editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi).

+ The [Most ambiguous language - 2005/chia](chia/index.html) entry is really a C program.

+ The [Most superfluous output - 2005/boutines](boutines/index.html) entry is simply
[Voronoi](Voronoi)-lific!

+ Try not to have your sense of good coding offended by the [Most
discourteous interpreter - 2005/timwi](timwi/index.html) entry.

+ The [Best use of the www - 2005/mynx](mynx/index.html) doesn't include those letters.

+ You will be puzzled by the [Best 3D puzzle - 2005/anon](anon/index.html) entry; we are sure!

+ The [Most ingenious puzzle solution - 2005/aidan](aidan/index.html) might puzzle you more while it
puzzles out some puzzles: all in a puzzling way!  :-)

### Remarks on some of the losing entries

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

+ depended too much on non-portable side effects in expressions; and/or

+ depended too much on a particular byte order; and/or

+ required the use of a special script, data file or pseudo-machine
  language that was not supplied with the entry.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and resubmit
them for the next IOCCC.
