## To build:

        make all

[Cody Boone Ferguson](/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) fixed this for
modern systems. For the original file see below. Thank you Cody for your
assistance!


## Alternate code:

If you have an older compiler you can try compiling the original source code
which is true symmetry:

	make alt


## To run:

	./westley


## Judges' comments:

Putchar must exist in the C library and not just as a macro.
If it fails to compile, add the line:  `#include <stdio.h>`  at the
top of the program.

Line by line symmetry performed better than any C beautifier.  Think
of if it as a C ink blot.  :-)

NOTE: This entry requires a non-standard K&R C compiler to compile.
