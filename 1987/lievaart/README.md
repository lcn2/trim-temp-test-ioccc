## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
```


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./lievaart
    # enter a level and start playing as described below
```


## Try:

To see what it would have looked like without the size restrictions:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./lievaart2
    # enter a level and start playing as described below
```


## Judges' remarks:

We believe that you too will be amazed at just how much power Mr. Lievaart
packed into 1024 bytes!

This Plays the game of Reversi
([Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi))!  Compile and run.  It then
asks for a playing level. Enter 0-10 (easy-hard).  It then asks for
your move. A move is a number within 11-88, or 99 to pass.  Illegal
moves (except for an illegal pass) are rejected.  Then the computer
does its move (or a 0 to pass), until the board is full.

It plays rather well, for such a small program! Lievaart had to leave out the
board printing routine, so you'll have to take a real game board to play it (or
see below). ...  Also due to space-limitations (the rules for 1987 had a limit
of 1024 byes), Lievaart took out the passing-handler, which makes its
ending-game rather poor.  But further it knows all the rules, uses [alpha-beta
pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning), and it plays for
instance on mobility(!).  Most important: it can play a pretty good game of Reversi!

The Author was kind enough to supply the fully functional version of the
program.  The file [lievaart2.c](%%REPO_URL%%/1987/lievaart/lievaart2.c) contains what the program would
have been without the size restriction.  This version has the full end game
logic and displays the board after each move! See above for how to use this.
