## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
    ```


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./wall
    # enter some numbers

    ./wall | some_command
    # enter some strings or numbers, depending on command
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```

You may of course run the commands manually and enter text as you wish. For
instance you might try one or both of:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./wall | bc

    ./wall | cat
```

and enter some input like:

```
    x*x
    2^x
    quit # for the cat version
```

which the script does through a pipeline except that here you can enter more
text if you wish, line by line.


## Judges' remarks:

What we found amazing was how the flow of control was transferred between
subroutines.  Careful inspection will show that the array of pointers to
functions named `vi` refers to functions which seem to not be directly called.
Even so, these pointers to functions are being used as an argument to
`signal(3)` (used both with and without an arg - but how?).  Can you determine
why this is being done and how it is being exploited?

Some compilers complained about this file, so we changed: `=++I` to `= ++I`.
