# Fourth International Obfuscated C Code Contest

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
compile it and how to run the winning program.  Look at the winning source and
try to figure how it does what it does!  You may then wish to look at the
Author's remarks for even more details.

The [rules for 1997](rules.txt) suggested even more categories than in 1986.
Hints for what to do and not to do were also given in the [rules](rules.txt).
For example, a simple excessive abuse of `/lib/cpp` was discouraged unless the
abuse was unusual.  The mailboxes for the contest were moved from nsc to amdahl.
The practice of posting a preliminary set of rules for the next year was started
this year.

[Rules](rules.txt) and results were posted to comp.lang.c and comp.unix.wizards
with an announcement in news.announce.important.
[Micro/Systems Journal](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?microsystemsjournal)
published the 1987 winning entries.  [Mary Ann Horton](../authors.html#Mary_Ann_Horton) included
a version of the [1987 winning entries](../years.html#1987) in an appendix of
her C book [Portable C Software International
Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Software-Mark-R-Horton/dp/0138680507).
The first announcement of winning entries at the Summer 87 USENIX was helped by
a small fly that danced all over the foils.
