1987 marked the "The Fourth International Obfuscated C Code Contest"


Look at the README.md file for the given winner for information
on how to compile the winner and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

The [rules for 1997](rules.txt) suggested even more categories than in 1986.
Hints for what to do and not to do were also given in the [rules](rules.txt).
For example, a simple excessive abuse of /lib/cpp was discouraged unless the
abuse was unusual.  The mailboxes for the contest were moved from nsc to amdahl.
The practice of posting a preliminary set of rules for the next year was started
this year.

[Rules](rules.txt) and results were posted to comp.lang.c and comp.unix.wizards with
an announcement in news.announce.important.  Micro/Systems Journal
published the 1987 winners.  [Mark R.
Horton](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Mark-R.-Horton/author/B001HPGRB8) included a version of the [1987
winners](../years.html#1987) in an appendix of his C book [Portable C Software International
Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Software-Mark-R-Horton/dp/0138680507).
The first announcement of winners at the Summer 87 Usenix was helped by a small
fly that danced all over the foils.
