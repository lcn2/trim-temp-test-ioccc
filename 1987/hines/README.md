## To build:

        make all

## To run

	./hines file.c

## Try:

	./hines hines.c

### Alternate code

An alternate version of this entry is in `hines.alt.c`. With older compilers you
can try the alt version:

    make alt

Use `hines.alt` as you would `hines` above.

## Judges' remarks

This program was designed to maximize the bother function for
structured programmers.  This program takes goto statements to their
logical conclusion.  The layout and choice of names are classic.

We consider this to be a beautiful counter-example for Frank Rubin's
letter to ACM form titled: _"'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered Harmful"_.
See the Communications of the ACM, March 1987, Page 195-196.
