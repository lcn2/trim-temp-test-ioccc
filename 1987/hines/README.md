## To build:

```sh
make all
```


## To use:

```sh
./hines file.c
```


### Try:

```sh
./hines hines.c
```

## Alternate code:

An alternate version of this entry is in [hines.alt.c](hines.alt.c). With older
compilers you can try the alt version:

```sh
make alt
```

Use `hines.alt` as you would `hines` above.


## Judges' remarks:

This program was designed to maximize the bother function for
structured programmers.  This program takes `goto` statements to their
logical conclusion.  The layout and choice of names are classic.

We consider this to be a beautiful counter-example for Frank Rubin's
letter to ACM form titled: _["'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered
Harmful"](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf)_.
See the Communications of the ACM, March 1987, Page 195-196.
