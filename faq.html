</div>
</div>
<p>To submit your code to the IOCCC, you <strong>MUST</strong> follow these steps:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Verify that the IOCCC is open for submissions</p>
<p>Check the <a href="status.json">status.json</a> URL and
check the <a href="news.html#news">IOCCC news</a> to
see of the IOCCC is open.</p>
<p>You may only register for the IOCCC
and you may only submit your entries to the IOCCC when the IOCCC is <strong>OPEN</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the latest IOCCC rules and review the IOCCC guidelines</p>
<p>Please pay close attention to the <a href="rules.html">official IOCCC rules</a>.</p>
<p>You are also <strong>highly encouraged</strong> to review the
<a href="guidelines.html">official IOCCC guidelines</a> as they contain important
suggestions, useful hints, and IOCCC humor. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Register for the IOCCC</p>
<p>The <strong>IOCCC registration procedure</strong> is still being designed.
<!--XXX--> As such, we do not yet have instructions on how to
use the <strong>IOCCC registration procedure</strong>. Once <strong>IOCCC
registration procedure</strong> is ready, we will update this section
with the proper instructions. Watch the <a href="news.html">IOCCC news</a>
for an annoucement about the <strong>IOCCC registration procedure</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you have been registered, you will receive an email message for how to
prepare your entries for submission, and how to upload the compressed tarballs
to our submission portal.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the latest mkiocccentry toolkit</p>
<p>If you do not have an mkiocccentry tool directory:</p>
<p>cd some_directory
git clone git@github.com:ioccc-src/mkiocccentry.git

<li><p>Run the mkiocccentry tool to form your entry tarball</p>
<p>./mkiocccentry work_dir prog.c Makefile remarks.md [file …]</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>work_dir directory where the entry directory and tarball are formed
prog.c path to the C source for your entry</p>
<p>Makefile Makefile to build (make all) and cleanup (make clean &amp; make clobber)</p>
<p>remarks.md Remarks about your entry in markdown format

See also <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/current/">CommonMark Spec</a>.</p>
<p>[file …] extra data files to include with your entry</p>
<p>NOTE: It is <em>NOT</em> necessary to install the tools to use them as you can run
the tools from the top of the <em>mkiocccentry repo</em> directory just fine.</p>
<p>If <code>mkiocccentry</code> tool indicates that there is a problem with your entry,
especially if it identifies a <a href="rules.html#2">rule 2</a> related problem,
you are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to revise and correct your entry and
then re-run the <code>mkiocccentry</code> tool.</p>
<p>If you choose to risk violating rules, be sure an explain your reason
for doing so in your _remarks.md file.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your entry to the IOCCC submit server</p>
<p>The <strong>IOCCC submit server</strong> is still being written as of 2024
Mar 10. <!--XXX--> As such, we do not yet have instructions
on how upload your entry to the <strong>IOCCC submit server</strong>. Once

<h3 id="faq-0.1-what-types-of-entries-have-been-over-submitted-to-the-ioccc">FAQ 0.1: What types of entries have been over-submitted to the IOCCC?</h3>
</div>
<p>There are types of entries that show up over and over again. The
IOCCC judges, and we suspect the public that enjoy viewing the
results of the IOCCC, like variety.</p>
<p>While it is possible to win a new IOCCC with one of these
<strong>over-submitted</strong> types of entries, level of the competition from
previous IOCCC entries make it more challenging to be successful.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the <a href="guidelines.html">guidelines</a> often
state something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We tend to dislike programs that: are similar to previous winning entries</em></p>

<h4 id="hints-on-overused-themes">Hints on overused themes</h4>
<p>HINT: It is not fatal to send in those types of entries, it is just MUCH
HARDER to win. Such an entry would have to do something <em>really unique <strong>AND</strong>
interesting</em> to even make it into the final judging rounds. Entries that
reuse these ‘worn out’ themes frequently lose to other entries that do
something different.</p>
<p>HINT: If you really MUST send in an entry based on an ‘overused theme’, be sure
that it is obfuscated in several new and novel ways. Be sure to <em>clearly</em>
explain near the beginning of your remarks why you are submitting a entry based
on an ‘overused theme’ and why the judges should not simply toss it out as being
boring.</p>

as found in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry GitHub repo</a>,
(renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course) as a starting point for your
entry’s <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> is a file used by the <code>make(1)</code> command that contains
rules and UNIX shell-style commands.</p>
<p>The first and default rule should be the “all” rule and should build your entry’s executable file.</p>
<p>If your entry depends on a particular source file name during compilation or execution,
your <code>Makefile</code> should copy <code>prog.c</code> into the desired filename. For example:</p>
<p>If you are not familiar <code>Makefile</code>s, you might consider the following tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction">GNU make</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile">What is a Makefile and how does it work?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://makefiletutorial.com">Learn Makefiles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the <code>make(1)</code> <em>connoisseur</em>: As of 2023, IOCCC judges use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU
make compatible</a> <code>make(1)</code>
command that is compatible with GNU Make version 3.81.</p>

<h3 id="faq-0.3-may-i-use-a-different-source-or-compiled-filename-than-prog.c-or-prog">FAQ 0.3: May I use a different source or compiled filename than prog.c or prog?</h3>
</div>
<p>While your entry’s source filename, as submitted, must be <code>prog.c</code>, your entry’s <code>Makefile</code>
may copy <code>prog.c</code> to a different filename as part of the compiling/building process. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    all: desired_name

    desired_name: desired_name.c
            cc desired_name.c -o $@

    desired_name.c: prog.c
            rm -f $@
            cp -f prog.c $@

    clobber:
            rm -f desired_name.c desired_name</code></pre>
<p>We recommend that the <code>make clobber</code> rule remove files that your entry
creates as part of the compiling/building process.</p>
<p>You may also copy the compiled <code>prog</code> into a different file as part of compiling process.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    different_name: prog
            rm -f $@
            cp -f prog $@</code></pre>
<div id="faq0_4">
<h3 id="faq-0.4-what-platform-should-i-assume-for-my-entry">FAQ 0.4: What platform should I assume for my entry?</h3>
</div>
<p>Your entry must compile with GCC and run under at least one flavor of UNIX (e.g.
Linux or Solaris). To improve chances to win, it should work under both BSD and
SysV style UNIX (think <strong>stty cbreak</strong>), and should not depend on “Endianness”.
If it can compile and run on Windows and/or Mac (see
<a href="2000/thadgavin/index.html">2000/thadgavin</a> for one example, amongst others),
even better. Being able to compile with other compilers like clang is also a
good thing.</p>

All generated HTML pages on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC web site</a>
start with some markdown content.</p>

</div>
<p>One day (1984 March 23 to be exact), Larry Bassel and I (Landon Curt
Noll) were working for National Semiconductor’s Genix porting group, we
were both in our offices trying to fix some very broken code.</p>
<p>Larry had been trying to fix a bug in the classic Bourne shell (C code <code>#define</code>d
to death to sort of look like Algol) and I had been working on the finger
program from early BSD (a bug ridden finger implementation to be sure).</p>
<p>We happened to both wander (at the same time) out to the hallway
in Building 7C to clear our heads.</p>
<p>We began to compare notes: ‘<em>You won’t believe the code I am trying to fix</em>’.</p>
<p>And: ’<em>Well you cannot imagine the brain damage level of the code I’m trying to
fix’</em>.</p>
<p>As well as: ’<em>It’s more than bad code, the author really had to try to make it
this bad!</em></p>
<p>After a few minutes we wandered back into my office where I posted a
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=789%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=3&amp;filter=0%22">flame to
net.lang.c</a>
inviting people to try and out obfuscate the UN*X source code we had just been working on.</p>
<p>BTW: I (Landon Curt Noll) had to post this <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=795%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=10&amp;filter=0">typo
correction</a>.
Thus began the tradition of putting typos in the contest rules and guidelines
… to make them more obfuscated of course! :-)</p>
<p>BTW: This posting was made back in the days when AT&amp;T was the evil giant.
Now, Microsoft makes AT&amp;T look mild and kind in comparison. :-( (IMHO) ).</p>
<p>BTW: See the story about the ‘<a href="1993/mills/index.html">Bill Gates</a>’ award. :-)</p>
<p>OK, back to the story.</p>
<p>We (Larry and I) received a number of entries by email.
When we began to receive messages from outside of the US, Larry and I
decided to include International in the name.</p>
<p>The
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0">1st IOCCC entries</a>
were posted on 17 April 1984.</p>
<p>There were 4 entries that won in 1984:</p>
<ol type="1">

</ol>
<p>BTW: The (dis)honorable mention wished to remain anonymous.
While many have asked who it was, we have continued to follow the
author’s wish to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we asked the author if they still wanted to remain anonymous.
They said: ‘<em>Yes, I want to keep my anonymity. But you can tell them that I am well known for my connection to the
C language</em>’. It was not until 2001 that another <a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">anonymous
entry</a> received an award.</p>
<p>BTW: The <a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> remains one of my (Landon Curt Noll) all time favorites.</p>
<p>The name used in the posting of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0">1st winning IOCCC
entry</a>
posting was <strong>I</strong>nternational <strong>O</strong>bfuscated <strong>C</strong> <strong>C</strong>ode <strong>C</strong>ontest or
<strong>IOCCC</strong> for short.</p>
<p>The posting said ‘<em>1st annual</em>’, so in 1985 we held the <a href="years.html#1985">2nd IOCCC contest</a>
and the tradition continues as the longest running contest on the Internet.</p>
<p>P.S. Part of the inspiration for making the IOCCC a contest goes to the
<a href="http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/">Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest</a>.</p>
<p>P^2.S. See the <a href="all/index.html">overall README</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 id="faq-1.1-why-are-some-years-missing-ioccc-entries">FAQ 1.1: Why are some years missing IOCCC entries?</h3>

<p>Some years, such as 1997, 1999, 2002-2003, 2007-2010, 2016-2017, 2021-2023, no IOCCC was held.</p>
<p>While we try to hold the IOCCC every year, sometime the other demands on the IOCCC judges
so not permit us to hold a new IOCCC.</p>
<p>The pause during the 2021-2023 period was due to the IOCCC judges developing tools to
make is much more likely for the IOCCC to be held in a yearly basis later on.</p>

mostly use frequent commits to individual components of the IOCCC,
rather than to use occasional site wide massive updates in order
to improve the tractability of changes made to components of the
IOCCC such as IOCCC entries although occasionally site wide updates
were performed in order to address an issue common to many IOCCC
entries. And while some people prefer infrequent updates to a repo
the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> believe
the ability to trace changes with commit messages is important.</p>
<p>Changes to the IOCCC content included things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving IOCCC entries into their own separate directories.</li>
<li>Establishing a detailed manifest for an IOCCC winning entries.</li>
<li>Fixing lots and lots of typos.</li>
<li>Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to be
compiled with/in modern systems.</li>
<li>Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to run
with/in modern systems.</li>
<li>Reworking the Makefiles to use a consistent set of rules.</li>
<li>Reworking the Makefiles specific to the gcc and clang C compilers.</li>
<li>Replacing the various hint files with a index.html markdown (from README.md
files) that is more consistent across IOCCC years.</li>
<li>Generating HTML content from markdown files and JSON data files via a <a href="/bin/index.html">set of
tools and scripts</a>.</li>
<li>Setting up a system whereby authors of IOCCC entries may update their own
contact information via a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a>.</li>
<li>Setting up to generate the top level <a href="years.html">years.html</a> file via the
<a href="/bin/gen-years.sh">gen-years.sh</a> tool.</li>
<li>Setting up to generate the top level <a href="/authors.html">authors.html file</a>, renamed
from <code>winners.html</code>, via the <a href="/bin/gen-authors.sh">gen-authors.sh</a> tool.</li>
<li>Making use of a new and improved <a href="/ioccc.css">IOCCC CSS</a> for web site consistency</li>

</div>
<p>While you may put in as much or as little as you wish into your entry’s
<code>remarks.md</code> file, we do have few important suggestions:</p>
<p>We recommend that you explain how to use your entry. Explain the
command line (if any command line options and arguments are used)
and any input or actions if applicable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you explain why you think your entry is
well obfuscated.</p>
<p>For those entries that win the IOCCC, we often use much of text from the
<code>remarks.md</code> file in the <em>Author’s remarks</em> section of the <code>index.html</code> file.
For this reason, a well written <code>remarks.md</code> file is considered a plus.</p>
<p>While not required, consider adding bit of humor to your <code>remarks.md</code>
as most people who are not humor impaired, as well as the IOCCC judges
appreciate the opportunity for a fun read as well as a chuckle or two.</p>
<h4 id="what-helps">What helps:</h4>
<ul>
<li>explaining what your entry does</li>
<li>how to entice it to do what it is supposed to do</li>
<li>what obfuscations are used</li>
<li>what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability and/or input data</li>
<li>how it works (if you are really condescending)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-not-help">What does not help:</h4>
<ul>
<li>admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest is
called the <strong>IOCCC</strong>, not the <strong>INVOCCC</strong> :-) ); but even if you do not admit
it, not very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win (although
<a href="2000/tomx/index.html">2000/tomx</a> is a notable counterexample).</li>
<li>mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section (or
in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the judging
rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry wins. See the guidelines if
this is not clear!</li>

<h3 id="faq-2.2-why-dont-you-publish-entries-that-do-not-win">FAQ 2.2: Why don’t you publish entries that do not win?</h3>

<h3 id="faq-2.3-how-much-time-does-it-take-to-judge-the-contest">FAQ 2.3: How much time does it take to judge the contest?</h3>

<p>It takes a fair amount of time to setup, run, answer email, process entries,
review entries, trim down the set entries to a set of winning entries, doing the
write-up of the entries, announcing the entries, reviewing final edits of the
winning entry set, posting the winning entries, being flamed :-), tell folks who send in
late entries to wait until the next contest, etc… It takes a few weekends and
a number nights of study and work … which is hard given that we are busy with
many other activities as well.</p>
<p>Note that we do not contact the author if an entry does not compile or does not
work as advertised, we might attempt to fix obvious compilation problems or
incompatibilities, but no more than that - so be sure that your entry does work
on at least a couple different platforms, at least one of them being UNIX or
POSIX-conforming.</p>

<p>Are you trying to trick us? :-)</p>
<p>By tradition, we do not say how many judging rounds we have in a given IOCCC.</p>
<p>We often report when the IOCCC judges start the 1st round, and
when usually report when the IOCCC judges start near final judging rounds, and
sometimes we also report when we enter what we believe is the final judging round, so you may guess that we have at least 3 rounds. :-) The actual number of rounds is certainly more than 3.</p>

<h3 id="faq-2.5-why-do-some-ioccc-entries-receive-the-grand-prize-or-best-of-show-award">FAQ 2.5: Why do some IOCCC entries receive the Grand Prize or Best of Show award?</h3>
</div>
<p>In some years, the IOCCC judges discover a truly amazing IOCCC entry that
stands out among all of the other IOCCC entries received that year.
For such an IOCCC entry, the IOCCC judges award a “Grand Prize”
or “Best of Show award.</p>
<p>In 1984-1987, the grand prize winning entries are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="years.html#1984_mullender">1984/mullender</a></li>
<li><a href="years.html#1985_shapiro">1985/shapiro</a></li>
<li><a href="years.html#1986_wall">1986/wall</a></li>
<li><a href="years.html#1987_lievaart">1987/lievaart</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from 1988, the entry we liked the most in that year is called
“Best of Show”. Here are the “Best of Show” entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="years.html#1988_applin">1988/applin</a></li>
<li><a href="years.html#1989_jar.2">1989/jar.2</a></li>

<li><a href="years.html#2020_carlini">2020/carlini</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the judges were unable to select a clear overall
winning entry. So to give a nod to the entry that had the highest approval ranking
from the judges, they used the following awards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="years.html#1993_rince">1993/rince</a> - Most Well Rounded</li>
<li><a href="years.html#1994_shapiro">1994/shapiro</a> - Most Well Rounded</li>
<li><a href="years.html#1995_leo">1995/leo</a> - Best Use of Obfuscation</li>
</ul>
<p>These could be considered the ‘best entry’ for those years with 1 or
more other entries that came in close behind.</p>

<h3 id="faq-3.0-what-makefile-rules-are-available-to-build-or-clean-up-ioccc-entries">FAQ 3.0: What Makefile rules are available to build or clean up IOCCC entries?</h3>
</div>
<p>In general the best way to compile everything in an entry directory is to run:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber all</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to compile every entry for every year you should go to the top level
directory and run the same command as above, <code>make clobber all</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>all</code> rule will build everything necessary except for the alternate
versions. Every Makefile has an <code>alt</code> rule but it will only do something if an
alternate version exists. To build all the entries along with any alternate code
you can do from the top level directory:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber everything</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to only build alternate code you can do:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber alt</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to not remove the entry binaries and only compile the additional alt
versions:</p>
<pre><code>    make alt</code></pre>
<p>The following Makefile rules should be in all Makefiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>all: build the entry programs (main program and any supplementary program)</li>
<li>alt: build alternate code</li>
<li>clobber: clean up object files and all binary files (except for those that are
not compiled)</li>
<li>clean: a simpler version of <code>clobber</code> that only removes object files. <code>make clobber</code> depends on <code>clean</code> so running <code>make clobber</code> will invoke <code>make clean</code>.</li>
<li>everything: equivalent to <code>make all alt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any other rules? You tell us!</p>
<p>NOTE about the above rules: the Makefile default assumes <code>cc</code> which might be a
gcc-based compiler, or a clang-based compiler, or some other compiler. Only by
forcing <code>CC=clang</code> or <code>CC=gcc</code> will one invoke a specific compiler to, say,
enable or disable additional warnings or flags. Even so different versions or
compilers might do different things, have different defects or other issues.</p>
<div id="faq3_1">
<h3 id="faq-3.1-why-doesnt-this-ioccc-entry-compile">FAQ 3.1: Why doesn’t this IOCCC entry compile?</h3>
</div>
<p>Some entries that won the IOCCC, particularly entries from long ago, no longer compile on more
modern systems because the C language has evolved (i.e. the modern C compilers
are much more strict in what they accept as a valid program), or the entry
depended on operation system and library features that where common back then
but are different/missing today.</p>
<p>Please see the other FAQs in this section as they might offer helpful
hints, especially in cases were something else needs to be installed.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for details about known problems with IOCCC entries. In some cases you may be dealing with a problematic entry. In a few fun cases, the IOCCC does not compile by design!</p>
<p>If you have a fix that makes a minimal impact to the entry, then
please consider submitting that change in the form of a pull request.
Please see <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry</a>. See also the <a href="#ull_request">FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request</a> for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>In some cases alternative code has been added that does compile on some or most systems. Check the write up for the entry for “alt” code and possible ways to compile and run that code. In some cases we replaced the original code (but not the <code>.orig.c</code> file!) with code
that works for modern systems but one can view the original code in the
<code>.orig.c</code> files (sometimes the original code is also in the directory as a
<code>dirname.alt.c</code> or <code>prog.alt.c</code>).</p>

<h3 id="faq-3.2-why-does-a-ioccc-entry-fail-on-my-64-bit-system">FAQ 3.2: Why does a IOCCC entry fail on my 64-bit system?</h3>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately some older entries are non-portable and require 32-bit support or
32-bit binaries. A problem system here is macOS Catalina (10.15) as as of that
version macOS no longer supports 32-bit binaries. If the entry acts on a certain
type of binary, say ELF, then that will also be a problem depending on the
entry. For example <a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a> requires 32-bit
ELF binaries.</p>
<p>There are numerous example entries that require 32-bit binaries. We have tried
to note these in both the respective Makefiles and index.html files but it is
possible that some were missed. These entries are very likely in the
<a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file and we welcome any help in making an alternate version
for 64-bit systems. Many were fixed to work with modern systems but some are
supposed to only work with 32-bit systems so any updated version of these
entries should be an alternate version.</p>
<p>Other entries like <a href="thanks-for-help.html#2001_herrmann2">2001/herrmann2</a>
now work with 32-bit AND 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for the problematic entry
in question to see if the problem is known, and if a fix is wanted,
consider trying to port the code to a 64-bit system and submitting
a pull request with that change. Pull requests that fix such code
while trying to minimize the impact of any changes and preserving
the spirit of the original code are very welcome! Please see <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ

<h3 id="faq-3.3-why-do-some-ioccc-entries-fail-to-compile-under-macos">FAQ 3.3: Why do some IOCCC entries fail to compile under macOS?</h3>
</div>
<p>If the entry requires gcc and you did not explicitly install gcc in macOS you
will not be able to run or use these entries. This is because macOS gcc is
actually clang, even <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>.</p>
<p>That being said many (if not most) of these entries have been fixed and some
others will be looked at, when found.</p>
<p>In some cases the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file may note a known macOS problem
with an entry. Should you manage to port the entry, and assuming your changes
also attempt to preserve the original intent of the IOCCC entry, we would
encourage you to submit a pull request with your ported code.

<h3 id="faq-3.4-why-does-clang-or-gcc-fail-to-compile-an-ioccc-entry">FAQ 3.4: Why does clang or gcc fail to compile an IOCCC entry?</h3>
</div>
<p>Although we have fixed numerous entries to work with clang (sometimes in an alt
version but usually in the program itself) there are some that simply cannot be
fixed or if they are fixable they have not yet been fixed (we are working on
this but other things have to be done too and all on free time).</p>
<p>This is because clang has some defects where the args of main() are required to
be a specific type and some versions of clang allow only 1, 2 or 3 args, not 4,
to main(). In the case of types of args many were changed to the right type and
then what was main() became another function of the original main() type.</p>
<p>At the same time some entries are not designed to work with clang. There might
be alternate code added at some point but as above this depends on free time and
other things that have to be done plus remembering to do it.</p>
<p>See if the problem is mentioned in <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>. If you have a change
that fixes the problem (even if it just a change to the <code>Makefile</code>) that doesn’t
negatively impact the entry too much, consider submitting that change in the

deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/install-xorg-on-linux">Linux for Devices tutorial on
XOrg</a> as
of 2023 Mar 25:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, RHEL developers categorized <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality">Xorg was put in the ‘deprecated’
software</a>,
as its development has mostly halted. Subsequent updates will completely replace
it with Wayland, a more modern windowing system.. Although Wayland is not fully
developed yet, many applications do not support it properly yet and screen
sharing might not work sometime, but it is the future. Fedora, also developed by
RHEL, has switched to a Wayland session as it’s default windowing system (And it
works flawlessly on my Laptop).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org">Wayland</a> web site for more details.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: We do <strong>NOT</strong> know if IOCCC entries will run under
<strong>Wayland</strong>. Some IOCCC entries that use X11 might be OK while other IOCCC
entries that use X11 in an unusual way might fail under <strong>Wayland</strong>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html">Wayland FAQ</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>If your system uses <strong>Wayland</strong> and not X11, you might give the IOCCC entries
that use X11 a try. They might work but again we do not know.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> <a href="#no_support">do not support IOCCC entries</a>.
So if an IOCCC entry that uses X11 fails under <strong>Wayland</strong>, and you wish to

then consider <a href="#fix_an_entry">submitting a fix</a> so that it will run under <strong>Wayland</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<p>First, see the above note on <a href="#X11_general">installing and starting Xorg</a>.
However, for macOS, instead of installing the Xorg server, you need to install and launch
the <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent XQuartz</a> application
and then run the IOCCC entry from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window
shell</a>.</p>
<p>As an example we will use <a href="1993/jonth/index.html">1993/jonth</a> which works
with macOS 14.2.1 (macOS Sonoma).</p>
<p>First of all you will need to install the <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent
XQuartz</a>, preferably on an <a href="https://support.apple.com/macOS">Apple supported version of
macOS, preferably the most recent version</a>.
After it is installed, open the “XQuartz” application (usually located in
<code>/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</code>) by typing at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>    open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</code></pre>
<p>With the “XQuartz” application open you will get an <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">X Window System
Manager</a> launched with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window
shell</a> started:</p>
<p><img alt="xterm-launch in macOS" src="png/xquartz-shell.png"></p>
<p>At this point you need to cd to the winning directory and compile it. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="compiling an entry in xterm in macOS" src="png/xquartz-entry-compile.png"></p>
<p>And then run the program as directed by the <code>index.html</code> file. For example with
<code>1993/jonth</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="running 1993/jonth in macOS" src="png/xquartz-1993-jonth.png"></p>
<p>Note that you can compile the code in your regular terminal prior to opening
XQuartz, should you wish to. You can even run it from that terminal and it
should open XQuartz.</p>

<h3 id="faq-3.11-why-do-makefiles-use--weverything-with-clang">FAQ 3.11: Why do Makefiles use -Weverything with clang?</h3>
</div>
<p>While we know that use of <code>-Weverything</code> is generally not recommended
by <code>clang</code> C compiler developers, we do use the <code>-Weverything</code>
option in a certain case in IOCCC entry <code>Makefile</code>s.</p>
<p>The use of <code>-Weverything</code> is limited to when one forces <code>CC=clang</code> or more
generally if the string ‘clang’ is in <code>$(CC)</code>. If <code>$(CC)</code> contains ‘gcc’ the
‘gcc’ specific options are run instead.</p>
<p>Users with clang compilers are not required to set <code>CC=clang</code> or equivalent but
when they do, <code>-Weverything</code> is enabled with all of its challenges, pedantic
warnings, and sometimes warnings about things that do not matter, some of which
are frankly frivolous and often downright dubious.</p>
<p>To enable this feature:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber all CC=clang</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber all &#39;CWARN+= -Weverything&#39;</code></pre>
<p>though it should be noted that if one tries <code>-Weverything</code> with compilers that
are not <code>clang</code> they <em>might</em> see something like:</p>
<pre><code>    echo &#39;int main(void) {}&#39; &gt; foo.c ; cc -Weverything foo.c -o foo
    cc: error: unrecognized command-line option &#39;-Weverything&#39;</code></pre>
<p>which means that it can’t even be compiled. Thus the proper way to do it is the
first way, <code>make clobber all CC=clang</code>.</p>
<p>IOCCC authors who have access to <code>clang</code> might wish to try their
hand at compiling with <code>-Weverything</code> while using a minimum of <code>-Wno-foo</code>
statements. Sometimes there is a technical or pedantic issue that
<code>-Weverything</code> warns about that would merit a change to your C code; often,
however, it is not even possible to fix let alone is it worth it. Of course
if you’re running out of bytes due to rule 2[ab] one might not have much choice.
This is something that obfuscation authors simply sometimes have to deal with!</p>
<p>If you try to minimize the number of <code>-Wno-foo</code> options needed with
<code>-Weverything</code>, please mention this in your remarks about the entry, as the
judges note you attempt to honor it (see also below). In some cases your
obfuscated code will issue warnings with <code>-Weverything</code> no matter what: the
<code>-Wno-poison-system-directories</code> is a common example of this but there are
others as well, sometimes depending on the version of <code>clang</code>.</p>
<p>If you do try for a compile with <code>clang -Weverything</code>, keep on mind that while <em>your</em>
compile environment might be warning free, a different clang version or a
different build environment might still have warnings. For instance the warning
set is different in macOS (which by default is <code>clang</code>: even when run as <code>gcc</code>!)
than Linux (due to versions and possibly other things)!</p>
<p>Given that your entry <strong>MUST</strong> work as documented, you may be safer to
say that your entry keeps the number of warnings and <code>-Wno-foo</code> options while
compiling with <code>clang -Weverything</code> at a minimum. You might want to say the
version number and platform too as an extra safety net. Because if you claim zero
warnings, and we find a warning situation, this may diminish the value of your
entry as it is not as documented. Thus it might be wise to point this out and
if you can test it in multiple platforms (or versions of <code>clang</code>, see
below note) this would be advisable.</p>
<p>NOTE: different versions of <code>clang</code> have other differences as well. For instance
a defect of <code>clang</code> that required numerous entries to be fixed for clang is that it
requires that <code>main()</code>’s arguments to be of a specific type. However some
versions of <code>clang</code> are more strict in the number of args allowed. These reasons
are part of why numerous entries had to be modified so that <code>main()</code> calls
another function instead of doing it all in <code>main()</code> (another reason was that
some entries that recursively called <code>main()</code> caused a crash or otherwise broke
the entry in modern systems). Some entries do not work in <code>clang</code> (or at least do
not work completely) due to these defects, for instance
<a href="1989/westley/index.html">1989/westley</a>; <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone
Ferguson</a> was able to
get much of it to work and looking at that entry might be of value to your
submissions, at least if you can figure the code out :-). To see the
differences, try from <code>1989/westley</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    make diff_orig_prog</code></pre>
<p>If you have <code>colordiff</code> try:</p>
<pre><code>    make DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively you can try:</p>
<pre><code>    git diff d2a42f42e8f477f29e9d5ed09ce2bb349eaf7397..eb9e69fde657acc8c85a618a8a99af4c2f93b21d westley.c</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, using <code>clang</code> has some additional problems to work out but if
you can get your entry to work well in <code>clang</code> it might very well be considered
better than other entries.</p>

<h3 id="faq-3.12-how-do-i-find-out-how-to-send-interrupteof-etc.-for-entries-that-require-it">FAQ 3.12: How do I find out how to send interrupt/EOF etc. for entries that require it?</h3>
</div>
<p>For some entries one needs to send interrupt or EOF or some other signal/other
special characters. There are typical defaults like (where <code>^</code> = ctrl):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^D</code> for EOF (<code>eof</code>)</li>
<li><code>^C</code> for interrupt (<code>intr</code>)</li>
<li><code>^U</code> for kill (<code>kill</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and various others. But if you don’t know this you can find out through the
<code>stty(1)</code> command with the <code>-a</code> option. For instance with macOS you might see:</p>
<pre><code>    $ stty -a
    speed 9600 baud; rows 40; columns 155;
    intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; [..snip..]</code></pre>
<p>If you know the name you can use <code>grep</code> to find the correct line and if your
implementation of <code>grep(1)</code> has the <code>-o</code> option you can filter it. For instance
to find what the <code>intr</code> is set to:</p>
<pre><code>    $ stty -a |grep -o &#39;intr = ^[[:alpha:]]&#39;
    intr = ^C</code></pre>
<p>… assuming of course that it’s a ctrl combination :-) If for some strange
reason it’s not you might have to do something else including just piping it to
just <code>grep intr</code> or whatever.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>What may have worked years ago may not work well or work at all today.
Please note that the IOCCC judges do <strong>NOT</strong> support IOCCC entries.
Nevertheless, there may be a number of reasons why an IOCCC entry
may fail to compile or run well or fail to run on your system.</p>
<p>In some cases the American National Standards Institute’s ANSI C
committee has damaged the C standard to the point where perfectly
valid C programs no longer compile with modern compilers. As such
some old IOCCC entries cannot no longer be compiled with modern compilers.</p>
<p>In some cases programs that may have worked on an old computer system
longer work on modern computers. Some IOCCC entries do not work well,
or no longer work on modern computers or modern operating systems.
Some IOCCC entries fail to compile under clang, or gcc.
Some IOCCC entries require operating system services that
may not be present on your system.</p>
<p>In some cases the IOCCC entry simply has bugs or (Mis)features.</p>
<p>If you are having problems compiling or running an IOCCC entry,
we recommend that you look in <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> to see if
there is a known bugs or (Mis)feature. In some cases what you
may think is a bug is actually an feature that was intentionally
written by the authors. In some cases the problem is well
known and we are looking for someone to attempt to fix it.</p>
<p>In some cases there is an alternate version of the IOCCC entry
that you may wish to try.</p>
<p>It also possible that you may have discovered a bug in an winning IOCCC
entry. If so, you are invited to try an fix the IOCCC entry and
submit that fix by way of a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a>.

<p>For the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC</a> <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry submission
toolkit</a> and the <a href="years.html">winning IOCCC
entries</a> we support <em>ONLY</em> GNU Makefile syntax. This means that if
you only have Cygwin or a BSD <code>make(1)</code> (often <code>bmake(1)</code>) or some other
<code>make(1)</code> utility the Makefiles we use will not be compatible.</p>
<p>We do not intend on supporting anything but the GNU <code>make(1)</code> utility so if you
do not currently have it installed you will have to do that in order to compile
entries for the IOCCC. If you are submitting an entry this will also be
necessary.</p>
<p>If you do not have GNU <code>make(1)</code> you might look for <code>gmake</code> as that is what it
often is packaged as. Then you can use <code>gmake</code> instead. For instance if you go
to the top level directory of the winner repo you can do:</p>
<pre><code>    gmake</code></pre>
<p>In the case that the Makefile uses the <code>MAKE</code> variable you will have to override
it like:</p>
<pre><code>    gmake MAKE=gmake</code></pre>
<p>though of course for both you may specify a rule or rules to run.</p>

</div>
<p>It is very likely in this case that the code was fixed to work for modern
systems as part of the reworking of the website. If you have this problem in
some entries you should look at the original code as in <code>dirname.orig.c</code> or
<code>prog.orig.c</code>. <code>dirname</code> is the directory name. For instance, one of Landon’s
favourite entries of all time is <a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> and
the entry’s dirname there would be <code>mullender</code>. Sometimes the original is in an alt
version like <code>dirname.alt.c</code> or <code>prog.alt.c</code>. In fact it is advisable to look at
the original code when reading the author’s (and sometimes authors’) remarks.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Some may wonder: “Doesn’t this tamper with the entry too much?”</p>
<p>A fine line indeed has to be drawn here but it was decided that it is worth it
because of alarming warnings that can be displayed, in some systems at runtime
interspersed with the output of the program.</p>
<p>For instance in macOS the entry <a href="1990/tbr/index.html">1990/tbr</a> would output the
warning in such a way that caused confusing output for the entry, looking like:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./tbr
    $ warning: this program uses gets(), which is unsafe.
    # nothing here, what to do?</code></pre>
<p>In some cases changing the code to use <code>fgets()</code> is not so easy to fix and in
one case at least there is an alternate version that has the fix instead due to
a problem it creates (correct output but segfaults after the output in one of
the forms of input).</p>
<p>In some cases it is not possible to fix or at least it is highly unlikely and so
those have mainly not been touched except one that has had the buffer size
increased (which could be done for others that are not possible to change to
<code>fgets()</code> though this has not been done).</p>
<p>Some entries can be made to look almost identical to the original entry. For
instance the fix to <a href="1988/reddy/index.html">1988/reddy</a> required only a single
<code>#define</code> be added.</p>
<p>In the future we, the judges, would prefer that entries use <code>fgets()</code> to prevent
these problems.</p>
<p>An annoying fact is that for ‘“compatibility” reasons’ <code>fgets()</code> retains the
newline and <code>gets()</code> does not. As the Unix version 7 man page used to say:</p>
<pre><code>    BUGS

    The fgets(3) function retains the newline while gets(3) does not, all in the
    name of backward compatibility.</code></pre>
<p>We’re not sure how this is compatibility but either way it can cause a
problem and it is this that has complicated most of the fixes though again some
can look almost identical.</p>

<div id="what_changed">
<h3 id="faq-4.2-what-was-changed-in-an-ioccc-entry-source-code">FAQ 4.2: What was changed in an IOCCC entry source code?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have set up make rules to easily do see what was changed in the winning IOCCC
entry source. Using the <code>Makefile</code> in the entry directory, use
one of the following <em>make(1)</em> rules:</p>
<p>The following <code>make</code> rules exist to make a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make diff_orig_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the <em>original</em> source to the
current source (that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to <code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make make diff_alt_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the original
code (that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>). If no alt code exists
nothing will be shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_alt_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the entry as it
stands (that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_orig_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the original code to the alt code
(that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the alt code (that is
<code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the original code (that is
<code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance one of Landon’s all time favourite entries is
<a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> so the file names would be:
<code>mullender.orig.c</code>, <code>mullender.alt.c</code> and <code>mullender.c</code>. For later years, it
would be instead <code>prog.orig.c</code>, <code>prog.alt.c</code> and <code>prog.c</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you might see something like:</p>
<pre><code>    make: [Makefile:170: diff_orig_prog] Error 1 (ignored)</code></pre>
<p>at the end of the output but this is completely normal if there are differences.</p>
<p>If the alt code is the same as the original, say with
<a href="1984/anonymous/index.html">1984/anonymous</a>, then naturally there is no point in
running the rule and the same applies for all the other rules but this system
allows for easily seeing the diffs.</p>
<p>As some examples we’ll first look at one that has really long lines which
will make it harder to see what is different,
<a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a>. What you would do is <code>cd 2001/anonymous</code> and then do:</p>
<pre><code>    make diff_orig_prog</code></pre>
<p>and then be really confused! :-)</p>
<p>But for an entry like <a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a>, you can see the
differences much more easily. <code>1991/dds</code> is a good example where it’s very
simple to see what is different as it’s just a couple lines.</p>
<p>You might be quite surprised how little some entries had to be changed and at
the same time how much other entries had to be changed, often with quite complex
differences! In some cases if the line is rather long, like the above mentioned
one, it will be harder to see what changed but in other cases like
<a href="1984/decot/index.html">1984/decot</a> or <a href="1986/wall/index.html">1986/wall</a> it’s a
lot easier.</p>
<p>Well, at least it’s easier see the differences on a line-by-line basis but maybe
not what actually changed, especially since it’s easier to know what was fixed
when you have compiler errors :-) (though there are, as noted, some examples
where it’s quite easy to see the differences).</p>
<p><a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a> is also a good example to see the alt difference
very easily. To do that <code>cd 1991/dds</code> and then do:</p>
<pre><code>    make diff_alt_prog</code></pre>
<p>and you’ll see a single line changed and very simply.</p>
<h4 id="tip-if-you-have-colordiff-installed-its-a-lot-easier-to-see-the-differences">Tip: if you have <code>colordiff</code> installed it’s a lot easier to see the differences</h4>
<p>To use these rules but provide a different <code>diff</code>, for instance <code>colordiff</code>,
just do:</p>
<pre><code>    make DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog # for orig to prog diff
    make DIFF=colordiff diff_alt_prog # for alt to prog diff</code></pre>
<p>Obviously if you want to view the alt code or the orig code you can just open
the files as described above.</p>

</div>
<p>If the entry has been fixed for modern systems and this fix required
modification to the code then invariably there will be entries where the remarks
of the author or authors are inconsistent with the original code, the size of
the code might be against rule 2 and other kinds of inconsistencies might also
be there.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend that when you read the remarks, sometimes the judges’
remarks and always the author’s or authors’ remarks, you look at the original
code. When the entry source code is called <code>prog.c</code> the original code is in
<code>prog.orig.c</code>; otherwise it is <code>dirname.orig.c</code>. For instance one of Landon’s all
time favourite entries is <a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> and the
original code is in <a href="1984/mullender/mullender.orig.c">mullender.orig.c</a>. In
some cases, such as <code>1984/mullender</code>, the original code is the same as the code
as no changes were made (there is an alt version for systems that are not
VAX-11/PDP-11, however).</p>

<h4 id="some-html-files-should-not-be-directly-modified">Some HTML files should NOT be directly modified</h4>
<p>Nearly all HTML files on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC web site</a>
are built from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> files.
If you see lines containing:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means that the file is generated by a tool from a <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tool</a>.
You should <strong>NOT</strong> attempt to modify the file.</p>
<p>You may also find lines slightly below the above set that suggest another file to edit.
For example, in <a href="contact.html">contact.html</a>, one may read:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means that you could consider editing the referenced markdown file
in your <a href="#pull_request">IOCCC pull request</a>.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ 5.2 How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC
entry</a>. See also the <a href="#ull_request">FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request</a> for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>In some cases, the HTML file is <strong>NOT</strong> based on markdown content, but instead
came from JSON and other data files. So instead of the above reference to a
markdown file, you will read:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- The main section of this web page came from JSON and other data files --&gt;
    &lt;!-- --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh --&gt;
    &lt;!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh --&gt;
    &lt;!-- The main section of this web page was generated via the tool: bin/gen-years.sh --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means there is <strong>NOT even a markdown file to edit</strong>. Instead one must
modify JSON files and/or change a <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tool</a>.</p>
<p>If this happens, consider opening up an <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues">IOCCC issue</a>

</div>
</div>
<p>We would appreciate if you try to fix the broken (the link goes nowhere) or wrong
(the link goes to something that clearly is not the original intent) web link.
If wish to fix such links, you may open a GitHub pull request as described in
<a href="#fix_web_site">FAQ 5.4</a>. In the case of dead links or invalid links it doesn’t matter
if it’s a specific winner or not; the procedure is the same: open a pull request
to fix the problem. See also the <a href="#ull_request">FAQ 6.10 How does someone
make a change to a file and submit that change as a GitHub pull
request</a> for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>As far as how to find the updated link you can try using the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback
Machine</a> and see if you can find the last non 4xx non
3xx page. Note, however, that just because it redirects, does not mean it’s not
valuable. Other times you might find it with a web search.</p>
<p>Some links were changed to more recent URLs by doing this exact
same thing. Some links, while they were a valid web page, no longer
reach the intended web page (for example when the domain is sold
and the new domain owner’s content no longer provides the content
that was originally intended .. and while the content of the web
page may be humorous to some, the original content may have literally
gone “up in smoke”).</p>
<p>In cases where the original content is lost, try searching for it on
the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a>. When searching
look back for dates that are around the year of given IOCCC contest.
If you do find the original content in Internet archive history,
please consider submitting a change to replace the link accordingly.</p>
<p>If there is no alternative that you can find you might want to remove the link
instead by replacing the link with just phrase of text. For example,
if the text in some <code>index.html</code> file was:</p>
<pre><code>    See the [author&#39;s description of the program](https://example.com) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that the author’s description cannot be found in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> archive, then
replace that text with:</p>
<pre><code>    See the **author&#39;s description of the program** (sorry the content is no longer available) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>If you just wish to report the bad link issue, see <a href="#report_web_problem">FAQ 5.3</a>.</p>

<h3 id="faq-6.5-what-is-an-author-handle">FAQ 6.5: What is an author handle?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>An <code>author_handle</code> is string that refers to a given author and is unique to the
IOCCC. Each author has exactly one <code>author_handle</code>.</p>
<p>For each <code>author_handle</code>, there will be a JSON file of the form:</p>
<pre><code>    author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="#author_json">FAQ 6.6</a> for information about the contents of these JSON file and
how they are used.</p>
<p>Because the <code>author_handle</code> is used to form a JSON filename, the string must be
POSIX safe string plus the use of <code>+</code> (for technical reasons beyond this
answer). In particular, the <code>author_handle</code> must be an ASCII string that
matches this regexp:</p>
<pre><code>    ^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z._+-]*$&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Default <code>author_handle</code>’s do not have multiple consecutive <code>_</code> (underscore)
characters. Nevertheless, multiple consecutive <code>_</code> (underscore) characters are
allowed. Contest submitters who wish to override their default <code>author_handle</code> may do so.</p>
<p>The <code>author_handle</code> is derived from the name of the author. While there is a
algorithm that maps the name of the author (which can contain any UTF-8
characters) into a default <code>author_handle</code> string, those who submit an entry to
the IOCCC are free to choose a different <code>author_handle</code> string if they so
desire.</p>
<p>An <code>author</code> who has won a previous IOCCC is encouraged to reuse their
<code>author_handle</code> so that new winning entries can be associated with the same
author.</p>
<p>For an anonymous <code>author</code>, their handle is one of these forms:</p>
<pre><code>    Anonymous_year</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>    Anonymous_year.digits</code></pre>
<p>The latter form is in case there are more than one anonymous author in a given
year.</p>
<p>NOTE: even if the directory name is not <code>anonymous</code> the above rules apply as in
in the case of <a href="2005/anon/anon.c">2005/anon</a>.</p>
<p>Anonymous <code>author_handle</code>’s match this regexp:</p>
<pre><code>    Anonymous_[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][.0-9]*$</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="#fix_author">FAQ 5.5</a> for information about how to update
and/or correct IOCCC author information.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: The contents of these JSON files contain the best known
information about authors of IOCCC entries and is used to help form
HTML files as well to contact an author.</p>
<p>The content of these JSON files are used by tools from a <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tool</a>
to help build HTML content for the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web site</a>.
For example, the <code>index.html</code> file for each IOCCC entry contains
selected information about the authors. Tools from the <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory</a>
use the content of these JSON files to generate the <code>index.html</code> files for each IOCCC
winning entry.</p>
<p>Moreover, should the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> need to
contact an authors of a IOCCC entry, they will consult the contents
of the author’s JSON file for ways to contact them.</p>
<p>Each author of an IOCCC winning entry has their own <code>author_handle.json</code> file
of the form:</p>
<pre><code>    author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>where <em>author_handle</em> is an author handle. See <a href="#author_handle">FAQ 6.5</a> for more
information about an author handles.</p>
<h4 id="author_handle.json-json-file-contents">author_handle.json JSON file contents</h4>
<p>The syntax of a <code>author_handle.json</code> follows the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>.
See <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/jparse/json_index.html#so_called_json_spec">json_index.html</a>
for information on the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the JSON file contents of a <code>author_handle.json</code> file
is to look at an example, the <code>author_handle.json</code> file for Yusuke Endoh:</p>
<pre><code>    author/Yusuke_Endoh.json</code></pre>
<p>As of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em>, the contents was as follows:</p>

<p>We now will walk thru the above JSON document looking at various JSON members:</p>
<h5 id="no_comment">no_comment</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;no_comment&quot; : &quot;mandatory comment: because comments were removed from the original JSON spec&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>Because the authors of the so-called JSON spec removed the ability to use comments in JSON
(for reason(s) that seem to be less than credible), the IOCCC mandates this <em>JSON member</em>
be present in all IOCCC related JSON files.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>no_comment</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be the exact <em>JSON string</em> as shown above.</p>
<h5 id="author_json_format_version">author_JSON_format_version</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;author_JSON_format_version&quot; : &quot;1.0 2023-06-10&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the format version of the <code>author_handle.json</code> JSON file.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>author_JSON_format_version</code>
<em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> the version of the contents! When updating an
<code>author_handle.json</code> JSON file, <strong>DO NOT MODIFY author_JSON_format_version</strong>!
As of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em>, the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be <em>“1.0 2023-06-10”</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>author_JSON_format_version</em> would only changed when the overall format
of the these files is modified: and then only those who maintain the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web site</a> would be the one to do this
in conjunction with changes to <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tools</a>.</p>
<h5 id="author_handle">author_handle</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;author_handle&quot; : &quot;Yusuke_Endoh&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the author handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>author_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em>
and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> that is also a value author handle.</p>
<p>See <a href="#author_handle_faq">FAQ 6.5</a> for more information about an author handles.</p>
<p>Normally the <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> should <strong>NOT</strong> be changed
<strong>unless there is a strong reason to do so</strong>. If the <em>JSON value</em>
changes, then all of the <code>.entry.json</code> files for all of this authors
winning IOCCC entries should also be changed. The <em>author_handle</em>
<em>JSON value</em> must match the basename (without the leading path and
without the trailing <code>.json</code>) of the <code>author_handle.json</code> file. So
a change of <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> would also require the
<code>author_handle.json</code> file to also be renamed.</p>
<h5 id="full_name">full_name</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;full_name&quot; : &quot;Yusuke Endoh&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the full name of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>full_name</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The full name of an author may use non-ASCII characters so long as the
full name is properly encoded as a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<h5 id="sort_word">sort_word</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;sort_word&quot; : &quot;endoh&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the string that will be used to sort the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>. Moreover the string <strong>MUST</strong> be a lower case ASCII
alphanumeric string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter.</p>
<p>The <em>JSON value</em> is used, for example, to place a reference to the author
in the <code>/authors.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Normally the <code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> <em>JSON value</em> is the last
name of the author, translated into lower case ASCII alphanumeric
string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter. If the author
wishes to be found in the <code>/authors.html</code> file under a different
string, such as if they wish to be listed under their first name
or their username, then they may change this accordingly.</p>
<h5 id="location_code">location_code</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;location_code&quot; : &quot;JP&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the string that is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code</a>
of the author’s location or country.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>location_code</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>. Moreover the string <strong>MUST</strong> be 2 character UPPER case ASCII
alphabetic string that is <strong>NOT</strong> an Unassigned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code</a> value
(not a 2 character symbol with a gray background on that Wikipedia table)</p>
<p>The <code>soup/location</code> tool from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>,
when run without arguments, will print the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes that permitted, along with
the location name.</p>
<p>We use the term “location” (and not “country”) because some of the
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes belong to locations that are not technically
a country, such as “Antarctica” or a User-assigned code.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify a location, they should select <strong>XX</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="email">email</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;email&quot; : &quot;mame@ruby-lang.org&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the email address of the author, or is the value null.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>email</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the email address is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;email&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="url">url</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : &quot;https://mametter.hatenablog.com&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the URL of the author’s home page.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the URL is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="alt_url">alt_url</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;alt_url&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds an alternate or 2nd URL a home page for the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>In some cases the author may wish to record a special URL for their IOCCC entry,
or a 2nd URL such as a work or school or personal home page. For example,
Cody as of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em> used:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;alt_url&quot; : &quot;https://ioccc.xexyl.net&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the alternate URL is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="deprecated_twitter_handle">deprecated_twitter_handle</h5>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> used to hold the twitter handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>The IOCCC no longer is associated with twitter (or whatever someone chooses to call it),
and so the <code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code> is <strong>no longer used</strong>. A <em>JSON value</em> that is
not a <em>JSON null</em> is kept for only historic reasons. For example, Anthony C. Howe
once used:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;deprecated_twitter_handle&quot; : &quot;@SirWumpus&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an twitter handle, or if the twitter handle is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;deprecated_twitter_handle&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="mastodon">mastodon</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;mastodon&quot; : &quot;@mame@ruby.social&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)">Mastodon social network</a>
handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>mastodon</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em> just be a valid
Mastodon handle. In particular is must start with an at sign (<em><span class="citation" data-cites="_">@_</span>), followed by the
Mastodon username, followed by a 2nd sign (</em>@_), followed by the Mastodon server instance
used by the author.</p>
<p>For more information in Mastodon, see the <a href="https://mastodon.help">Mastodon help</a> guide.
See the “Mastodon Address” section of that page in particular.</p>
<p>The IOCCC Mastodon handle is:</p>
<pre><code>    @ioccc@fosstodon.org</code></pre>
<p>The IOCCC uses the Mastodon social network for announcements such
as the opening and closing of a new IOCCC, changes to the IOCCC web
site, updates during the judging process, and when new IOCCC entries
are selected. We recommend you follow us on Mastodon.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon handle, or if the Mastodon handle is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;mastodon&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="mastodon_url">mastodon_url</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;mastodon_url&quot; : &quot;https://ruby.social/@mame&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the URL of the author’s Mastodon page.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>mastodon_url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em> just be a valid URL.
If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON null</em>, them the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.
If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON string</em>, then the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>mastodon_url</code> is just a translation of the above mentioned <a href="#mastodon">mastodon</a> handle.
For example, if the Mastodon handle is:</p>
<pre><code>    @user@server.domain</code></pre>
<p>Then the <code>mastodon_url</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code>    https://server.domain/@user</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon URL, or if the Mastodon URL is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;mastodon_url&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>

<h5 id="github">github</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;github&quot; : &quot;@mame&quot;,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>github</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <code>github</code> <em>JSON string</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
start with an at sign (_<span class="citation" data-cites="_">@_</span>) and <strong>MUST</strong> be a valid GitHub username.</p>
<p>The IOCCC uses GitHub to hold the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">official winner repo of the IOCCC</a>,
and hosts <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web site</a> on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>The IOCCC GitHub handle is:</p>
<pre><code>    @ioccc-src</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an GitHub handle, or if the GitHub handle is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;github&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="affiliation">affiliation</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;affiliation&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the affiliation of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>affiliation</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>An affiliation might be the name of a school, university, company, or organization.
It is recommended that the affiliation <em>JSON string</em> be the formal affiliation name.
For example, the affiliation for the IOCCC would be:</p>
<pre><code>    The International Obfuscared C Code Contest</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an affiliation, or if the affiliation is
unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;affiliation&quot; : null,</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="winning_entry_set">winning_entry_set</h5>

        { &quot;entry_id&quot; : &quot;2020_endoh3&quot; }
    ]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>winning_entry_set</code> <em>JSON member</em> holds <em>JSON array</em> containing one or more <code>entry_id</code> _JSON member_s.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>winning_entry_set</code> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a non-empty <em>JSON array</em>. Each value in that <em>JSON array</em> <strong>MUST</strong> must contain
a <em>JSON member</em> whose <em>JSON name</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be “<em>entry_id</em>” and those <em>JSON value</em>
is a valid entry ID.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>, the last value of the <code>winning_entry_set</code>
<em>JSON array</em> cannot end in a comma (<em>,</em>).</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>A <code>entry_id</code> is a string that identifies a winning entry of the IOCCC.</p>
<p>A <code>entry_id</code> is a 4-digit year, followed by an underscore, followed by a directory name.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>entry_id</code> associated with Cody Boone Ferguson’s 2nd winning IOCCC entry
of 2020 is found under the following directory:</p>
<pre><code>    2020/ferguson2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>entry_id</code> for that winning entry is:</p>

<h3 id="faq-6.8-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-.top-.year-and-.path-files">FAQ 6.8: What is the purpose of the .top, .year and .path files?</h3>
</div>
<p>The <a href=".top">.top</a> file resides at the top directory. This file contains the complete list
of IOCCC years.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC year. one will find a <code>.year</code> file. These files contain directory paths from the top directory,
of the IOCCC entry directories for a given year. For example, see the <a href=".1984/.year">1984/.year</a> file.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC entry directory, you will find a <code>.path</code> file.
These files contain the directory path from the top directory.
For example see <a href="1984/anonymous/.path">1984/anonymous/.path</a>.</p>
<p>The .top, .year and .path files are generated from the top level Makefile, by:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The IOCCC is now attempting to use the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>author</em> is someone who has submitted an entry that has won the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An entry can have more than one authors. A number of authors have submitted
entries that have won the IOCCC, sometimes in the same IOCCC contest year.</p>
<p><strong>An apology for being inconsistent</strong>: In the past, the IOCCC used the term <em>winner</em> to
refer to what is now an <em>author</em>. In a number of historical cases,
such as old rules and old guidelines, terms such as <em>winner</em> may still be
found. Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old
names such as <em>winner</em> when they should use <em>author</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>entry</em> is a submission that won the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> has one or more <em>authors</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> includes all of the files needed to compile it,
plus sample input files, a <code>Makefile</code>, an <code>.entry.json</code> file
describing the entry, a compressed tarball containing all of
files in the entry, etc. Under the IOCCC tree, an <em>entry</em>
that win the IOCCC in year <em>YYYY</em> is located under the
directory <code>YYYY/entry</code>.</p>

names such as <em>winner</em> when they should use <em>entry</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>submission</em> is something given to the IOCCC judges
for consideration when the IOCCC is open.</p>
<p>When the IOCCC is open for submissions, those who register
to enter the IOCCC may use the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry tool</a>
to package their code into a compressed tarball that may be
uploaded to the <a href="https://submit.ioccc.org">IOCCC submit server</a>.
This compressed tarball is formatted in such a way that
the IOCCC judges do not see who wrote the code.</p>
<p>A <em>submission</em> that the IOCCC judges deem to have won the IOCCC
becomes an <em>entry</em>. Only then do the IOCCC judges look into
the special JSON file to discover who the <em>author</em>(s) are.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>First, if you do not already have a GitHub account or you have not installed an
ssh key to your account you must do so. For this we will assume you do not have
a GitHub account. For the steps following creating a GitHub account you will
have to be logged into your account.</p>
<p>To help you out here is a navigation menu in this FAQ entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub account</a></li>
<li><a href="#installing-an-ssh-key">Installing an ssh key to GitHub</a></li>

<li><a href="#what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a merge</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub account</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and click on ‘Sign up’. Follow the
instructions. Once you’ve completed this task make sure you log in to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="installing-an-ssh-key-to-github">Installing an ssh key to GitHub</h4>
<p>Assuming you do not have an ssh key you should go to the command prompt and
type (if you already have one and are okay using it for GitHub you can use that
one):</p>
<pre><code>    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;luser@example.com&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>luser@example.com</code> is the email you want associated with your key.
Follow the instructions. It will tell you the key files.</p>
<p>Once you have an ssh key you need to go to your <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">account
settings</a>. Once there, in the menu
on the left you should see the item <em>SSH and GPG keys</em>. Click that and then
click (on the right side) the button that says <em>New SSH key</em>. You will see that
you have to specify a title, the key type and the PUBLIC key. Put whatever title
you want and keep the key type as <em>Authentication Key</em>. Now you need to put the
PUBLIC key in.</p>
<p>If you used an rsa key the default file will likely be found in:
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. If you used a different algorithm the file name will be
different. For instance if you used <code>ed25519</code> the default PUBLIC key file would
be <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>. If, like some people do, you have a separate key for
GitHub, it could be anything you wish, as long as it’s in <code>~/.ssh</code>. For instance
it might be <code>~/.ssh/github.pub</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever the key file is, copy the contents and paste it into the GitHub field
labelled <em>Key</em>. Once you have done so click on <em>Add SSH key</em>.</p>
<h4 id="forking-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo">Forking the temp-test-ioccc repo</h4>
<p>Open in your browser the link:
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/fork" class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/fork</a>. You now should follow the
instructions in forking the repo.</p>
<h4 id="cloning-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo">Cloning the temp-test-ioccc repo</h4>
<p>Once you have forked the repo you are ready to clone it to your system. For
instance Cody Boone Ferguson has the GitHub handle <em>xexyl</em> so he would type in:</p>
<pre><code>    git clone https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc [target_dir]</code></pre>
<p>Once that is completed you will need to change to that directory. The default
directory would be the name of the repo but if you specified a target directory
it will be that. For instance using the above example you might do:</p>
<pre><code>    cd temp-test-ioccc</code></pre>
<p>You’re ready to make your changes now!</p>
<h4 id="making-changes-fixes-etc.">Making changes, fixes etc.</h4>
<p>Here you must use your wits, knowledge, creativity and whatever else you have.
Let’s say that Cody wants to update his file
<a href="2020/ferguson1/play.sh">/2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a> script. He would open it in
his editor of choice (in his case vim) and make the changes. He would then make
sure (as there is a last updated date) to update the last updated date. For
instance he might add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BTW: did you know that some people believe in snake human hybrids? It’s true! See
http://www.macroevolution.net/snake-human-hybrids.html and have a laugh, shock
or an exercise in sibilance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, assuming that the date is 1 March 2024, he would update the line that
starts with <code># Last updated:</code> to refer to <code>01 March 2024</code> rather than what it
is now (at the time of writing this), <code>15 April 2023</code>.</p>
<p>But what if he wanted to add a file? He’d create the file and then type:</p>
<pre><code>    git add foo</code></pre>
<p>where <em>foo</em> is the file to add.</p>
<p>When he’s ready to make a commit he would need to create a new branch for the
pull request.</p>
<h4 id="committing-your-changes">Committing your changes</h4>
<p>First, as an aside, if this is your first pull request (which we assume is if you’re
reading this :-) ) you need to make sure that you can push changes to GitHub
with your ssh key. To do this you need to do:</p>
<pre><code>    ssh -T git@github.com</code></pre>
<p>Cody would see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi xexyl! You’ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, assuming that the forked repo is
<a href="https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc" class="uri">https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc</a>, you’d type:</p>
<pre><code>    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:xexyl/temp-test-ioccc.git</code></pre>
<p>Now you’d be ready to make your commits.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else, however, a new branch needs to be created.
Continuing the example above for
<a href="2020/ferguson1/play.sh">2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a>, it might be that:</p>
<pre><code>    git checkout -B human-snakes</code></pre>
<p>This would change the branch to the newly created branch <code>human-snakes</code> branch.
Now Cody could commit the changes:</p>
<pre><code>    git commit play.sh # if specifying specific files
    git commit -a # if committing everything</code></pre>
<p>He could also have done:</p>
<pre><code>    git add play.sh
    git commit</code></pre>
<p>In any case this would open an editor (in his case vim) to write a commit log.
It is recommended that the first line is &lt;=51 chars and the next line is blank.
Then if necessary add a description for the log. For instance the above might
warrant the log:</p>
<pre><code>    Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh

    Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
    script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</code></pre>
<p>Now a pull request has to be opened.</p>
<h4 id="opening-a-pull-request">Opening a pull request</h4>
<p>To do this depends on the branch name. Assuming the branch from above,
<code>human-snakes</code>, you would type:</p>
<pre><code>    git push --set-upstream origin human-snakes</code></pre>
<p>This might show:</p>
<pre><code>    Enumerating objects: 9, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
    Delta compression using up to 10 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 739 bytes | 147.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 5 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), completed with 4 local objects.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for &#39;human-snakes&#39; on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc/pull/new/human-snakes
    remote:
    To github.com:xexyl/temp-test-ioccc.git
     * [new branch]     human-snakes -&gt; human-snakes
    branch &#39;human-snakes&#39; set up to track &#39;origin/human-snakes&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>The link referred to above would then be opened to open a pull request. Just
follow the instructions at this point. If however it does not show a link it is
likely because the branch already exists in your GitHub account (for the repo).
In this case you can open the link:
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls" class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls</a> which might show something
like:</p>
<pre><code>    xexyl:human-snakes had recent pushes 1 minute ago</code></pre>
<p>and to the right of it you would see a button that says <em>Compare &amp; pull request</em>
which you could click on. Do that and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>An important note is if you have more than one pull request opened it’ll only
show the branch name as the summary. You should in that case copy paste the log
you put in into the website. For instance the line (on the website) <em>Add a
title</em> could have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the text field that is labelled <em>Add a description</em> would have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve done this you should click on <em>Create pull request</em>.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: although the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> will
give more deference to the authors of edited entries the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> also retain the final editorial say
in the matter.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a merge</h4>
<p>When the judges have merged the pull request you now need to make sure your fork
has the merge. To do this from the command line, assuming the fork in the above
example, you would type:</p>
<pre><code>    git checkout master &amp;&amp; git pull https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc.git master &amp;&amp; git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>This will merge your pull request to your fork.</p>
