0.0: How may I submit to the IOCCC?</h3>
<p>To submit your code to the IOCCC, you <strong>MUST</strong> follow
these steps:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Verify that the IOCCC is open for submissions</p>
<p>Check the <a href="status.json">status.json</a> URL and check the <a
href="news.html#news">IOCCC news</a> to see of the IOCCC is open.</p>
<p>You may only register for the IOCCC and you may only submit your
entries to the IOCCC when the IOCCC is <strong>OPEN</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the latest IOCCC rules and review the IOCCC guidelines</p>
<p>Please pay close attention to the <a href="rules.html">official IOCCC
rules</a>.</p>

important suggestions, useful hints, and IOCCC humor. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Register for the IOCCC</p>
<p>XXX - instructions TBD - XXX</p>
<p>Once you have been registered, you will receive an email message for
how to prepare your entries for submission, and how to upload the
compressed tarballs to our submission portal.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain the latest mkiocccentry toolkit</p>
<p>If you do not have an mkiocccentry tool directory:</p>
<p>cd some_directory git clone git@github.com:ioccc-src/mkiocccentry.git

0.1: What types of entries have been over-submitted to the IOCCC?</h3>
<p>There are types of entries that show up over and over again. The
IOCCC judges, and we suspect the public that enjoy viewing the results
of the IOCCC, like variety.</p>
<p>While it is possible to win a new IOCCC with one of these
<strong>over-submitted</strong> types of entries, level of the
competition from previous IOCCC entries make it more challenging to be
successful.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the <a
href="guidelines.html">guidelines</a> often state something along the
lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We tend to dislike programs that: are similar to previous winning
entries</em></p>

<h4 id="hints-on-overused-themes">Hints on overused themes</h4>
<p>HINT: It is not fatal to send in those types of entries, it is just
MUCH HARDER to win. Such an entry would have to do something <em>really
unique <strong>AND</strong> interesting</em> to even make it into the
final judging rounds. Entries that reuse these ‘worn out’ themes
frequently lose to other entries that do something different.</p>
<p>HINT: If you really MUST send in an entry based on an ‘overused
theme’, be sure that it is obfuscated in several new and novel ways. Be
sure to <em>clearly</em> explain near the beginning of your remarks why
you are submitting a entry based on an ‘overused theme’ and why the
judges should not simply toss it out as being boring.</p>
<h3
id="faq-0.2-what-should-i-put-in-my-entrys-makefile"><a name="faq0_2"></a>FAQ
0.2: What should I put in my entry’s Makefile?</h3>
<p>We recommend starting with the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">sample
Makefile</a> as found in the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry GitHub
repo</a>, (renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course) as a starting
point for your entry’s <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> is a file used by the <code>make(1)</code>
command that contains rules and UNIX shell-style commands.</p>
<p>The first and default rule should be the “all” rule and should build
your entry’s executable file.</p>
<p>If your entry depends on a particular source file name during
compilation or execution, your <code>Makefile</code> should copy
<code>prog.c</code> into the desired filename. For example:</p>
<p>If you are not familiar <code>Makefile</code>s, you might consider
the following tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction">GNU
make</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile">What
is a Makefile and how does it work?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://makefiletutorial.com">Learn Makefiles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the <code>make(1)</code> <em>connoisseur</em>: As of 2023, IOCCC
judges use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make
compatible</a> <code>make(1)</code> command that is compatible with GNU
Make version 3.81.</p>
<h3
id="faq-0.3-may-i-use-a-different-source-or-compiled-filename-than-prog.c-or-prog"><a name="faq0_3"></a>FAQ
0.3: May I use a different source or compiled filename than prog.c or
prog?</h3>
<p>While your entry’s source filename, as submitted, must be
<code>prog.c</code>, your entry’s <code>Makefile</code> may copy
<code>prog.c</code> to a different filename as part of the
compiling/building process. For example:</p>
<pre class="make"><code>all: desired_name

desired_name: desired_name.c
    cc desired_name.c -o $@

desired_name.c: prog.c
    rm -f $@
    cp -f prog.c $@

clobber:
    rm -f desired_name.c desired_name</code></pre>
<p>We recommend that the <code>make clobber</code> rule remove files
that your entry creates as part of the compiling/building process.</p>
<p>You may also copy the compiled <code>prog</code> into a different
file as part of compiling process. For example:</p>
<pre class="make"><code>different_name: prog
    rm -f $@
    cp -f prog $@</code></pre>
<h3
id="faq-0.4-what-platform-should-i-assume-for-my-entry"><a name="faq0_4"></a>FAQ
0.4: What platform should I assume for my entry?</h3>
<p>Your entry must compile with GCC and run under at least one flavor of
UNIX (e.g. Linux or Solaris). To improve chances to win, it should work
under both BSD and SysV style UNIX (think <strong>stty cbreak</strong>),
and should not depend on “Endianness”. If it can compile and run on
Windows and/or Mac (see <a
href="years.html#2000_thadgavin">2000/thadgavin</a> for one example,
amongst others), even better. Being able to compile with other compilers
like clang is also a good thing.</p>

1.0: How did the IOCCC get started?</h3>
<p>One day (1984 March 23 to be exact), Larry Bassel and I (Landon Curt
Noll) were working for National Semiconductor’s Genix porting group, we
were both in our offices trying to fix some very broken code.</p>
<p>Larry had been trying to fix a bug in the classic Bourne shell (C
code <code>#define</code>d to death to sort of look like Algol) and I
had been working on the finger program from early BSD (a bug ridden
finger implementation to be sure).</p>
<p>We happened to both wander (at the same time) out to the hallway in
Building 7C to clear our heads.</p>
<p>We began to compare notes: ‘<em>You won’t believe the code I am
trying to fix</em>’.</p>
<p>And: ’<em>Well you cannot imagine the brain damage level of the code
I’m trying to fix’</em>.</p>
<p>As well as: ’<em>It’s more than bad code, the author really had to
try to make it this bad!</em></p>
<p>After a few minutes we wandered back into my office where I posted a
<a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=789%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=3&amp;filter=0%22">flame

source code we had just been working on.</p>
<p>BTW: I (Landon Curt Noll) had to post this <a

correction</a>. Thus began the tradition of putting typos in the contest
rules and guidelines … to make them more obfuscated of course! :-)</p>
<p>BTW: This posting was made back in the days when AT&amp;T was the
evil giant. Now, Microsoft makes AT&amp;T look mild and kind in
comparison. :-( (IMHO) ).</p>
<p>BTW: See the story about the ‘<a href="1993/mills/index.html">Bill
Gates</a>’ award. :-)</p>
<p>OK, back to the story.</p>
<p>We (Larry and I) received a number of entries by email. When we began
to receive messages from outside of the US, Larry and I decided to
include International in the name.</p>

<p>BTW: The (dis)honorable mention wished to remain anonymous. While
many have asked who it was, we have continued to follow the author’s
wish to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we asked the author if they still wanted to remain
anonymous. They said: ‘<em>Yes, I want to keep my anonymity. But you can
tell them that I am well known for my connection to the C
language</em>’. It was not until 2001 that another <a
href="years.html#2001_anonymous">anonymous entry</a> received an
award.</p>
<p>BTW: The <a href="years.html#1984_mullender">1984/mullender</a>
remains one of my (Landon Curt Noll) all time favorites.</p>

<p>The posting said ‘<em>1st annual</em>’, so in 1985 we held the <a
href="years.html#1985">2nd IOCCC contest</a> and the tradition continues
as the longest running contest on the Internet.</p>
<p>P.S. Part of the inspiration for making the IOCCC a contest goes to
the <a href="http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/">Bulwer-Lytton fiction
contest</a>.</p>

1.1: Why are some years missing IOCCC entries?</h3>
<p>Some years, such as 1997, 1999, 2002-2003, 2007-2010, 2016-2017,
2021-2023, no IOCCC was held.</p>
<p>While we try to hold the IOCCC every year, sometime the other demands
on the IOCCC judges so not permit us to hold a new IOCCC.</p>
<p>The pause during the 2021-2023 period was due to the IOCCC judges
developing tools to make is much more likely for the IOCCC to be held in
a yearly basis later on.</p>

<p>A <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/discussions/1918">decision
was made by the IOCCC</a> to mostly use frequent commits to individual
components of the IOCCC, rather than to use occasional site wide massive
updates in order to improve the tractability of changes made to
components of the IOCCC such as IOCCC entries. Although occasionally
site wide updated were performed in order to address an issue common to
many IOCCC entries. And while some people prefer infrequent updates to a
repo the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>
believe the ability to trace changes with commit messages is
important.</p>
<p>Changes to the IOCCC content included things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving IOCCC entries into their own separate directories</li>
<li>Establishing a detailed manifest for an IOCCC winning entries</li>
<li>Fixing lots and lots of typos</li>
<li>Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to

<li>Fixing Makefiles and code to allow for nearly all winning entries to

<li>Reworking the Makefiles to use a consistent set of rules</li>
<li>Reworking the Makefiles specific to the gcc and clang C

<li>Replacing the various hint files with a index.html markdown that is
more consistent across IOCCC years</li>
<li>Generating HTML content from markdown files and JSON data files via

<li>Setting up a system whereby authors of IOCCC entries may update

entry’s <code>remarks.md</code> file, we do have few important
suggestions:</p>
<p>We recommend that you explain how to use your entry. Explain the
command line (if any command line options and arguments are used) and
any input or actions if applicable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you explain why you think your entry is well
obfuscated.</p>
<p>For those entries that win the IOCCC, we often use much of text from
the <code>remarks.md</code> file in the <em>Author’s remarks</em>
section of the <code>index.html</code> file. For this reason, a well
written <code>remarks.md</code> file is considered a plus.</p>
<p>While not required, consider adding bit of humor to your
<code>remarks.md</code> as most people who are not humor impaired, as
well as the IOCCC judges appreciate the opportunity for a fun read as
well as a chuckle or two.</p>
<h4 id="what-helps">What helps:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>explaining what your entry does</p></li>
<li><p>how to entice it to do what it is supposed to do</p></li>
<li><p>what obfuscations are used</p></li>
<li><p>what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability

<li><p>how it works (if you are really condescending)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-not-help">What does not help:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the
contest is called the <strong>IOCCC</strong>, not the
<strong>INVOCCC</strong> :-) ); but even if you do not admit it, not
very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win (although <a
href="years.html#2000_tomx">2000/tomx</a> is a notable
counterexample).</p></li>
<li><p>mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark
section (or in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased
during the judging rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry
wins. See the guidelines if this is not clear!</p></li>
<li><p>leaving the remark section empty.</p></li>

id="faq-2.2-why-dont-you-publish-entries-that-do-not-win"><a name="faq2_2"></a>FAQ
2.2: Why don’t you publish entries that do not win?</h3>
<p>Because the publication on the IOCCC site
<strong><em>IS</em></strong> the award! Anyone is free to put their
IOCCC hopefuls, lookalikes and/or entries that do not win on their web
page for everyone to see.</p>
<h3
id="faq-2.3-how-much-time-does-it-take-to-judge-the-contest"><a name="faq2_3"></a>FAQ
2.3: How much time does it take to judge the contest?</h3>
<p>It takes a fair amount of time to setup, run, answer email, process
entries, review entries, trim down the set entries to a set of winning
entries, doing the write-up of the entries, announcing the entries,
reviewing final edits of the winning entry set, posting the winning
entries, being flamed :-), tell folks who send in late entries to wait
until the next contest, etc… It takes a few weekends and a number nights
of study and work … which is hard given that we are busy with many other
activities as well.</p>
<p>Note that we do not contact the author if an entry does not compile
or does not work as advertised, we might attempt to fix obvious
compilation problems or incompatibilities, but no more than that - so be
sure that your entry does work on at least a couple different platforms,
at least one of them being UNIX or POSIX-conforming.</p>

2.4: How many judging rounds do you have?</h3>
<p>Are you trying to trick us? :-)</p>
<p>By tradition, we do not say how many judging rounds we have in a
given IOCCC.</p>
<p>We often report when the IOCCC judges start the 1st round, and when
usually report when the IOCCC judges start near final judging rounds,
and sometimes we also report when we enter what we believe is the final
judging round, so you may guess that we have at least 3 rounds. :-) The
actual number of rounds is certainly more than 3.</p>

2.5: Why do some IOCCC entries receive the Grand Prize or Best of Show
award?</h3>
<p>In some years, the IOCCC judges discover a truly amazing IOCCC entry
that stands out among all of the other IOCCC entries received that year.
For such an IOCCC entry, the IOCCC judges award a “Grand Prize” or “Best
of Show award.</p>
<p>In 1984-1987, the grand prize winning entries are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1984_mullender">1984/mullender</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1985_shapiro">1985/shapiro</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1986_wall">1986/wall</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1987_lievaart">1987/lievaart</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from 1988, the entry we liked the most in that year is
called “Best of Show”. Here are the “Best of Show” entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1988_applin">1988/applin</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1989_jar.2">1989/jar.2</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1990_theorem">1990/theorem</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1991_brnstnd">1991/brnstnd</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1992_vern">1992/vern</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1996_august">1996/august</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1998_banks">1998/banks</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="years.html#2020_carlini">2020/carlini</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the judges were unable to select a clear
overall winning entry. So to give a nod to the entry that had the
highest approval ranking from the judges, they used the following
awards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1993_rince">1993/rince</a> - Most Well
Rounded</p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1994_shapiro">1994/shapiro</a> - Most Well
Rounded</p></li>
<li><p><a href="years.html#1995_leo">1995/leo</a> - Best Use of
Obfuscation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These could be considered the ‘best entry’ for those years with 1 or
more other entries that came in close behind.</p>

3.0: What Makefile rules are available to build or clean up IOCCC
entries?</h3>
<p>In general the best way to compile everything in an entry directory
is to run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> clobber all</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you wish to compile every entry for every year you should go to
the top level directory and run the same command as above,
<code>make clobber all</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>all</code> rule will build everything necessary except for
the alternate versions. Every Makefile has an <code>alt</code> rule but
it will only do something if an alternate version exists. To build all
the entries along with any alternate code you can do from the top level
directory:</p>
<pre><code>make clobber everything</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to only build alternate code you can do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> clobber alt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you wish to not remove the entry binaries and only compile the
additional alt versions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> alt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The following Makefile rules should be in all Makefiles:</p>
<ul>
<li>all: build the entry programs (main program and any supplementary
program)</li>
<li>alt: build alternate code</li>
<li>clobber: clean up object files and all binary files (except for
those that are not compiled)</li>
<li>clean: a simpler version of <code>clobber</code> that only removes
object files. <code>make clobber</code> depends on <code>clean</code> so
running <code>make clobber</code> will invoke
<code>make clean</code>.</li>
<li>everything: equivalent to <code>make all alt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any other rules? You tell us!</p>
<p>NOTE about the above rules: the Makefile default assumes
<code>cc</code> which might be a gcc-based compiler, or a clang-based
compiler, or some other compiler. Only by forcing <code>CC=clang</code>
or <code>CC=gcc</code> will one invoke a specific compiler to, say,
enable or disable additional warnings or flags. Even so different
versions or compilers might do different things, have different defects
or other issues.</p>
<h3
id="faq-3.1-why-doesnt-this-ioccc-entry-compile"><a name="faq3_1"></a>FAQ
3.1: Why doesn’t this IOCCC entry compile?</h3>
<p>Some entries that won the IOCCC, particularly entries from long ago,
no longer compile on more modern systems because the C language has
evolved (i.e. the modern C compilers are much more strict in what they
accept as a valid program), or the entry depended on operation system
and library features that where common back then but are
different/missing today.</p>
<p>Please see the other FAQs in this section as they might offer helpful
hints, especially in cases were something else needs to be
installed.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for details
about known problems with IOCCC entries. In some cases you may be
dealing with a problematic entry. In a few fun cases, the IOCCC does not
compile by design!</p>
<p>If you have a fix that makes a minimal impact to the entry, then
please consider submitting that change in the form of a pull request.
Please see FAQ 5.2 <a href="#fix_an_entry">“How may I submit a fix to an
IOCCC entry”</a> for details.</p>
<p>In some cases alternative code has been added that does compile on
some or most systems. Check the write up for the entry for “alt” code
and possible ways to compile and run that code. In some cases we
replaced the original code (but not the <code>.orig.c</code> file!) with
code that works for modern systems but one can view the original code in
the <code>.orig.c</code> files (sometimes the original code is also in
the directory as a <code>dirname.alt.c</code> or
<code>prog.alt.c</code>).</p>

3.2: Why does a IOCCC entry fail on my 64-bit system?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately some older entries are non-portable and require 32-bit
support or 32-bit binaries. A problem system here is macOS Catalina
(10.15) as as of that version macOS no longer supports 32-bit binaries.
If the entry acts on a certain type of binary, say ELF, then that will
also be a problem depending on the entry. For example <a
href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a> requires 32-bit ELF
binaries.</p>
<p>There are numerous example entries that require 32-bit binaries. We
have tried to note these in both the respective Makefiles and index.html
files but it is possible that some were missed. These entries are very
likely in the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file and we welcome any
help in making an alternate version for 64-bit systems. Many were fixed
to work with modern systems but some are supposed to only work with
32-bit systems so any updated version of these entries should be an
alternate version.</p>
<p>Other entries like <a
href="thanks-for-help.html#2001_herrmann2">2001/herrmann2</a> now work
with 32-bit AND 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for the
problematic entry in question to see if the problem is known, and if a
fix is wanted, consider trying to port the code to a 64-bit system and
submitting a pull request with that change. Pull requests that fix such
code while trying to minimize the impact of any changes and preserving
the spirit of the original code are very welcome! Please see FAQ 5.2

<h3
id="faq-3.3-why-do-some-ioccc-entries-fail-to-compile-under-macos"><a name="faq3_3"></a>FAQ
3.3: Why do some IOCCC entries fail to compile under macOS?</h3>
<p>If the entry requires gcc and you did not explicitly install gcc in
macOS you will not be able to run or use these entries. This is because
macOS gcc is actually clang, even <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>.</p>
<p>That being said many (if not most) of these entries have been fixed
and some others will be looked at, when found.</p>
<p>In some cases the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file may note a
known macOS problem with an entry. Should you manage to port the entry,
and assuming your changes also attempt to preserve the original intent
of the IOCCC entry, we would encourage you to submit a pull request with
your ported code. Please see FAQ 5.2 <a href="#fix_an_entry">“How may I
submit a fix to an IOCCC entry”</a> for details.</p>
<h3
id="faq-3.4-why-does-clang-or-gcc-fail-to-compile-an-ioccc-entry"><a name="faq3_4"></a>FAQ
3.4: Why does clang or gcc fail to compile an IOCCC entry?</h3>
<p>Although we have fixed numerous entries to work with clang (sometimes
in an alt version but usually in the program itself) there are some that
simply cannot be fixed or if they are fixable they have not yet been
fixed (we are working on this but other things have to be done too and
all on free time).</p>
<p>This is because clang has some defects where the args of main() are
required to be a specific type and some versions of clang allow only 1,
2 or 3 args, not 4, to main(). In the case of types of args many were
changed to the right type and then what was main() became another
function of the original main() type.</p>
<p>At the same time some entries are not designed to work with clang.
There might be alternate code added at some point but as above this
depends on free time and other things that have to be done plus
remembering to do it.</p>
<p>See if the problem is mentioned in <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>.
If you have a change that fixes the problem (even if it just a change to
the <code>Makefile</code>) that doesn’t negatively impact the entry too
much, consider submitting that change in the form of a pull request.

<p>The simplest way to do this is to type <code>reset</code>. If echo

install Xorg and related packages including development related
packages. If you have macOS see further down for different instructions.
Otherwise: in particular you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the Xorg server.</li>
<li>Configure the Xorg server for your graphics environment.</li>
<li>Install a X11 terminal application.</li>
<li>Start the Xorg server.</li>
<li>Launch the X11 terminal application.</li>
<li>Run the IOCCC entry in the X11 terminal application.</li>

Server is now deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>According to this <a
href="https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/install-xorg-on-linux">Linux
for Devices tutorial on XOrg</a> as of 2023 Mar 25:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, RHEL developers categorized <a
href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality">Xorg
was put in the ‘deprecated’ software</a>, as its development has mostly
halted. Subsequent updates will completely replace it with Wayland, a
more modern windowing system.. Although Wayland is not fully developed
yet, many applications do not support it properly yet and screen sharing
might not work sometime, but it is the future. Fedora, also developed by
RHEL, has switched to a Wayland session as it’s default windowing system
(And it works flawlessly on my Laptop).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org">Wayland</a> web
site for more details.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: We do <strong>NOT</strong> know if
IOCCC entries will run under <strong>Wayland</strong>. Some IOCCC
entries that use X11 might be OK while other IOCCC entries that use X11
in an unusual way might fail under <strong>Wayland</strong>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html">Wayland
FAQ</a> for more information.</p>
<p>If your system uses <strong>Wayland</strong> and not X11, you might
give the IOCCC entries that use X11 a try. They might work but again we
do not know.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The <a href="judges.html">IOCCC

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<p>First, see the above note on <a href="#X11_general">installing and
starting Xorg</a>. However, for macOS, instead of installing the Xorg
server, you need to install and launch the <a
href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent XQuartz</a> application and
then run the IOCCC entry from the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window shell</a>.</p>
<p>As an example we will use <a
href="1993/jonth/index.html">1993/jonth</a> which works with macOS
14.2.1 (macOS Sonoma).</p>
<p>First of all you will need to install the <a
href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent XQuartz</a>, preferably on an
<a href="https://support.apple.com/macos">Apple supported version of
macOS, preferably the most recent version</a>. After it is installed,
open the “XQuartz” application (usually located in
<code>/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</code>) by typing at the
command line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">open</span> /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the “XQuartz” application open you will get an <a
href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">X Window System Manager</a> launched with
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window shell</a>
started:</p>
<p><img alt="xterm-launch in macOS" src="png/xquartz-shell.png"></p>
<p>At this point you need to cd to the winning directory and compile it.
For example:</p>
<p><img alt="compiling an entry in xterm in macOS" src="png/xquartz-entry-compile.png"></p>
<p>And then run the program as directed by the <code>index.html</code>
file. For example with <code>1993/jonth</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="running 1993/jonth in macOS" src="png/xquartz-1993-jonth.png"></p>
<p>Note that you can compile the code in your regular terminal prior to
opening XQuartz, should you wish to. You can even run it from that
terminal and it should open XQuartz.</p>

<p>If you’re using macOS there are at least three ways to obtain it. You
can use Homebrew or MacPorts. If you do not wish to use either of those
package managers, you can always try to install via the package website.
For macOS we do recommend using Homebrew or MacPorts instead of using
the package website.</p>

<h3
id="faq-3.11-why-do-makefiles-use--weverything-with-clang"><a name="faq3_11"></a>FAQ
3.11: Why do Makefiles use -Weverything with clang?</h3>
<p>While we know that use of <code>-Weverything</code> is generally not
recommended by <code>clang</code> C compiler developers, we do use the
<code>-Weverything</code> option in a certain case in IOCCC entry
<code>Makefile</code>s.</p>
<p>The use of <code>-Weverything</code> is limited to when one forces
<code>CC=clang</code> or more generally if the string ‘clang’ is in
<code>$(CC)</code>. If <code>$(CC)</code> contains ‘gcc’ the ‘gcc’
specific options are run instead.</p>
<p>Users with clang compilers are not required to set
<code>CC=clang</code> or equivalent but when they do,
<code>-Weverything</code> is enabled with all of its challenges,
pedantic warnings, and sometimes warnings about things that do not
matter, some of which are frankly frivolous and often downright
dubious.</p>
<p>To enable this feature:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb27"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> clobber all CC=clang</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> clobber all <span class="st">&#39;CWARN+= -Weverything&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>though it should be noted that if one tries <code>-Weverything</code>
with compilers that are not <code>clang</code> they <em>might</em> see
something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&#39;int main(void) {}&#39;</span> <span class="op">&gt;</span> foo.c <span class="kw">;</span> <span class="fu">cc</span> <span class="at">-Weverything</span> foo.c <span class="at">-o</span> foo</span>
<span id="cb29-2"><a href="#cb29-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">cc:</span> error: unrecognized command-line option <span class="st">&#39;-Weverything&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which means that it can’t even be compiled. Thus the proper way to do
it is the first way, <code>make clobber all CC=clang</code>.</p>
<p>IOCCC authors who have access to <code>clang</code> might wish to try
their hand at compiling with <code>-Weverything</code> while using a
minimum of <code>-Wno-foo</code> statements. Sometimes there is a
technical or pedantic issue that <code>-Weverything</code> warns about
that would merit a change to your C code; often, however, it is not even
possible to fix let alone is it worth it. Of course if you’re running
out of bytes due to rule 2[ab] one might not have much choice. This is
something that obfuscation authors simply sometimes have to deal
with!</p>
<p>If you try to minimize the number of <code>-Wno-foo</code> options
needed with <code>-Weverything</code>, please mention this in your
remarks about the entry, as the judges note you attempt to honor it (see
also below). In some cases your obfuscated code will issue warnings with
<code>-Weverything</code> no matter what: the
<code>-Wno-poison-system-directories</code> is a common example of this
but there are others as well, sometimes depending on the version of
<code>clang</code>.</p>
<p>If you do try for a compile with <code>clang -Weverything</code>,
keep on mind that while <em>your</em> compile environment might be
warning free, a different clang version or a different build environment
might still have warnings. For instance the warning set is different in
macOS (which by default is <code>clang</code>: even when run as
<code>gcc</code>!) than Linux (due to versions and possibly other
things)!</p>
<p>Given that your entry <strong>MUST</strong> work as documented, you
may be safer to say that your entry keeps the number of warnings and
<code>-Wno-foo</code> options while compiling with
<code>clang -Weverything</code> at a minimum. You might want to say the
version number and platform too as an extra safety net. Because if you
claim zero warnings, and we find a warning situation, this may diminish
the value of your entry as it is not as documented. Thus it might be
wise to point this out and if you can test it in multiple platforms (or
versions of <code>clang</code>, see below note) this would be
advisable.</p>
<p>NOTE: different versions of <code>clang</code> have other differences
as well. For instance a defect of <code>clang</code> that required
numerous entries to be fixed for clang is that it requires that
<code>main()</code>’s arguments to be of a specific type. However some
versions of <code>clang</code> are more strict in the number of args
allowed. These reasons are part of why numerous entries had to be
modified so that <code>main()</code> calls another function instead of
doing it all in <code>main()</code> (another reason was that some
entries that recursively called <code>main()</code> caused a crash or
otherwise broke the entry in modern systems). Some entries do not work
in <code>clang</code> (or at least do not work completely) due to these
defects, for instance <a
href="1989/westley/index.html">1989/westley</a>; <a
href="../authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> was
able to get much of it to work and looking at that entry might be of
value to your submissions, at least if you can figure the code out :-).
To see the differences, try from <code>1989/westley</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb30-1"><a href="#cb30-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> diff_orig_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have <code>colordiff</code> try:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="#cb31-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively you can try:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> diff d2a42f42e8f477f29e9d5ed09ce2bb349eaf7397..eb9e69fde657acc8c85a618a8a99af4c2f93b21d westley.c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, using <code>clang</code> has some additional problems
to work out but if you can get your entry to work well in
<code>clang</code> it might very well be considered better than other
entries.</p>

3.12: How do I find out how to send interrupt/EOF etc. for entries that
require it?</h3>
<p>For some entries one needs to send interrupt or EOF or some other
signal/other special characters. There are typical defaults like (where
<code>^</code> = ctrl):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^D</code> for EOF (<code>eof</code>)</li>
<li><code>^C</code> for interrupt (<code>intr</code>)</li>
<li><code>^U</code> for kill (<code>kill</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and various others. But if you don’t know this you can find out
through the <code>stty(1)</code> command with the <code>-a</code>
option. For instance with macOS you might see:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb33"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb33-1"><a href="#cb33-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> stty <span class="at">-a</span></span>
<span id="cb33-2"><a href="#cb33-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">speed</span> 9600 baud<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">rows</span> 40<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">columns</span> 155<span class="kw">;</span></span>
<span id="cb33-3"><a href="#cb33-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">intr</span> = ^C<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">quit</span> = ^<span class="dt">\;</span> erase = ^<span class="pp">?</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="bu">kill</span> = ^U<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">eof</span> = ^D<span class="kw">;</span> <span class="ex">[..snip..]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you know the name you can use <code>grep</code> to find the
correct line and if your implementation of <code>grep(1)</code> has the
<code>-o</code> option you can filter it. For instance to find what the
<code>intr</code> is set to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb34-1"><a href="#cb34-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> stty <span class="at">-a</span> <span class="kw">|</span><span class="fu">grep</span> <span class="at">-o</span> <span class="st">&#39;intr = ^[[:alpha:]]&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb34-2"><a href="#cb34-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">intr</span> = ^C</span></code></pre></div>
<p>… assuming of course that it’s a ctrl combination :-) If for some
strange reason it’s not you might have to do something else including
just piping it to just <code>grep intr</code> or whatever.</p>

3.13: Why does an IOCCC entry fail to compile or or fail run?</h3>
<p>What may have worked years ago may not work well or work at all
today. Please note that the IOCCC judges do <strong>NOT</strong> support
IOCCC entries. Nevertheless, there may be a number of reasons why an
IOCCC entry may fail to compile or run well or fail to run on your
system.</p>
<p>In some cases the American National Standards Institute’s ANSI C
committee has damaged the C standard to the point where perfectly valid
C programs no longer compile with modern compilers. As such some old
IOCCC entries cannot no longer be compiled with modern compilers.</p>
<p>In some cases programs that may have worked on an old computer system
longer work on modern computers. Some IOCCC entries do not work well, or
no longer work on modern computers or modern operating systems. Some
IOCCC entries fail to compile under clang, or gcc. Some IOCCC entries
require operating system services that may not be present on your
system.</p>
<p>In some cases the IOCCC entry simply has bugs or (Mis)features.</p>
<p>If you are having problems compiling or running an IOCCC entry, we
recommend that you look in <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> to see if
there is a known bugs or (Mis)feature. In some cases what you may think
is a bug is actually an feature that was intentionally written by the
authors. In some cases the problem is well known and we are looking for
someone to attempt to fix it.</p>
<p>In some cases there is an alternate version of the IOCCC entry that
you may wish to try.</p>
<p>It also possible that you may have discovered a bug in an winning
IOCCC entry. If so, you are invited to try an fix the IOCCC entry and
submit that fix by way of a <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a>. Please see <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ 5.2</a> for how to
submit a fix to an IOCCC entry.</p>

4.0: Why are some winning entry remarks incongruent with the winning
IOCCC code?</h3>
<p>It is very likely in this case that the code was fixed to work for
modern systems as part of the reworking of the website. If you have this
problem in some entries you should look at the original code as in
<code>dirname.orig.c</code> or <code>prog.orig.c</code>.
<code>dirname</code> is the directory name. For instance, one of
Landon’s favourite entries of all time is <a
href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> and the entry’s
dirname there would be <code>mullender</code>. Sometimes the original is
in an alt version like <code>dirname.alt.c</code> or
<code>prog.alt.c</code>. In fact it is advisable to look at the original
code when reading the author’s (and sometimes authors’) remarks.</p>

4.1: Why were some calls to the libc function <code>gets(3)</code>
changed to use <code>fgets(3)</code>?</h3>
<p>Some may wonder: “Doesn’t this tamper with the entry too much?”</p>
<p>A fine line indeed has to be drawn here but it was decided that it is
worth it because of alarming warnings that can be displayed, in some
systems at runtime interspersed with the output of the program.</p>
<p>For instance in macOS the entry <a
href="1990/tbr/index.html">1990/tbr</a> would output the warning in such
a way that caused confusing output for the entry, looking like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb51-1"><a href="#cb51-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ./tbr</span>
<span id="cb51-2"><a href="#cb51-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> warning: this program uses gets<span class="er">(</span><span class="kw">)</span><span class="ex">,</span> which is unsafe.</span>
<span id="cb51-3"><a href="#cb51-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># nothing here, what to do?</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In some cases changing the code to use <code>fgets()</code> is not so
easy to fix and in one case at least there is an alternate version that
has the fix instead due to a problem it creates (correct output but
segfaults after the output in one of the forms of input).</p>
<p>In some cases it is not possible to fix or at least it is highly
unlikely and so those have mainly not been touched except one that has
had the buffer size increased (which could be done for others that are
not possible to change to <code>fgets()</code> though this has not been
done).</p>
<p>Some entries can be made to look almost identical to the original
entry. For instance the fix to <a
href="1988/reddy/index.html">1988/reddy</a> required only a single
<code>#define</code> be added.</p>
<p>In the future we, the judges, would prefer that entries use
<code>fgets()</code> to prevent these problems.</p>
<p>An annoying fact is that for ‘“compatibility” reasons’
<code>fgets()</code> retains the newline and <code>gets()</code> does
not. As the Unix version 7 man page used to say:</p>
<pre><code>BUGS

The fgets(3) function retains the newline while gets(3) does not, all in the
name of backward compatibility.</code></pre>
<p>We’re not sure how this is compatibility but either way it can cause
a problem and it is this that has complicated most of the fixes though
again some can look almost identical.</p>

id="faq-4.2-what-was-changed-in-an-ioccc-entry-source-code"><a name="faq4_2"></a><a name="what_changed"></a>FAQ
4.2: What was changed in an IOCCC entry source code?</h3>
<p>We have set up make rules to easily do see what was changed in the
winning IOCCC entry source. Using the <code>Makefile</code> in the entry
directory, use one of the following <em>make(1)</em> rules:</p>
<p>The following <code>make</code> rules exist to make a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make diff_orig_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the <em>original</em> source to the
current source (that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to
<code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make make diff_alt_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the original code
(that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>). If no
alt code exists nothing will be shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_alt_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alt code to the entry as it
stands (that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_orig_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the original code to the alt code
(that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the alt code (that is
<code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the original code (that
is <code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance one of Landon’s all time favourite entries is <a
href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> so the file names
would be: <code>mullender.orig.c</code>, <code>mullender.alt.c</code>
and <code>mullender.c</code>. For later years, it would be instead
<code>prog.orig.c</code>, <code>prog.alt.c</code> and
<code>prog.c</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you might see something like:</p>
<pre><code>make: [Makefile:170: diff_orig_prog] Error 1 (ignored)</code></pre>
<p>at the end of the output but this is completely normal if there are
differences.</p>
<p>If the alt code is the same as the original, say with <a
href="1984/anonymous/index.html">1984/anonymous</a>, then naturally
there is no point in running the rule and the same applies for all the
other rules but this system allows for easily seeing the diffs.</p>
<p>As some examples we’ll first look at one that has really long lines
which will make it harder to see what is different, <a
href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a>. What you would do
is <code>cd 2001/anonymous</code> and then do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb54-1"><a href="#cb54-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> diff_orig_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then be really confused! :-)</p>
<p>But for an entry like <a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a>, you
can see the differences much more easily. <code>1991/dds</code> is a
good example where it’s very simple to see what is different as it’s
just a couple lines.</p>
<p>You might be quite surprised how little some entries had to be
changed and at the same time how much other entries had to be changed,
often with quite complex differences! In some cases if the line is
rather long, like the above mentioned one, it will be harder to see what
changed but in other cases like <a
href="1984/decot/index.html">1984/decot</a> or <a
href="1986/wall/index.html">1986/wall</a> it’s a lot easier.</p>
<p>Well, at least it’s easier see the differences on a line-by-line
basis but maybe not what actually changed, especially since it’s easier
to know what was fixed when you have compiler errors :-) (though there
are, as noted, some examples where it’s quite easy to see the
differences).</p>
<p><a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a> is also a good example to
see the alt difference very easily. To do that <code>cd 1991/dds</code>
and then do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="#cb55-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> diff_alt_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and you’ll see a single line changed and very simply.</p>
<h4
id="tip-if-you-have-colordiff-installed-its-a-lot-easier-to-see-the-differences">Tip:
if you have <code>colordiff</code> installed it’s a lot easier to see
the differences</h4>
<p>To use these rules but provide a different <code>diff</code>, for
instance <code>colordiff</code>, just do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb56"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb56-1"><a href="#cb56-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog <span class="co"># for orig to prog diff</span></span>

<p>Obviously if you want to view the alt code or the orig code you can
just open the files as described above.</p>

FAQ 4.3 - Why do author remarks sometimes not match the source and/or
why are there other inconsistencies with the original entry?</h3>
<p>If the entry has been fixed for modern systems and this fix required
modification to the code then invariably there will be entries where the
remarks of the author or authors are inconsistent with the original
code, the size of the code might be against rule 2 and other kinds of
inconsistencies might also be there.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend that when you read the remarks, sometimes
the judges’ remarks and always the author’s or authors’ remarks, you
look at the original code. When the entry source code is called
<code>prog.c</code> the original code is in <code>prog.orig.c</code>;
otherwise it is <code>dirname.orig.c</code>. For instance one of
Landon’s all time favourite entries is <a
href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> and the original
code is in <a
href="1984/mullender/mullender.orig.c">mullender.orig.c</a>. In some
cases, such as <code>1984/mullender</code>, the original code is the
same as the code as no changes were made (there is an alt version for
systems that are not VAX-11/PDP-11, however).</p>

help in fixing IOCCC entries</h3>
<p>The <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file, order by IOCCC years,
contains a list of known bugs &amp; (mis)features. If you are looking
for an IOCCC entry to try and fix, this file is a good place to
start.</p>
<p>See <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ 5.2</a> for information on how to
submit a fix to an IOCCC entry. Before you consider trying to fix an
IOCCC winning entry, please check the <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a>
file for the IOCCC entry in question. Note that in several cases what
you may have discovered, while a (mis)feature is not considered a bug
and should <strong>not be fixed</strong>. In cases where the bug is
known, the entry’s <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file section may
offer you important fixing clues.</p>

5.1: How do I report a bug in an IOCCC entry?</h3>
<p>We do not ‘maintain’ the contest entries as such. The code is made
available on an ‘AS IS’ basis. If you have a FIX for an entry, we
suggest that you submit your fixes in a <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> as we welcome pull requests that have a minimal impact on
the entry while improving the portability, functionality, and/or
addressing known problems.</p>
<p>If you do submit a pull request, we ask that each pull request
address just one IOCCC entry at a time.</p>
<p>Note that just because you have a fix does not mean it’ll be
accepted. This might be because the author objects or it doesn’t fit in
some way or another. Of course if the entry does not work we’ll
certainly be more inclined to accept the fix. If it is accepted we’ll be
happy to credit you in the <a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a>
file. If you’re a previous author of a winning IOCCC entry we will
happily link to your entries; if you’re not we can link to your website
if you wish.</p>
<p>See <a href="#fix_an_entry">FAQ 5.2</a> for information on how to

5.2: How may I submit a fix to an IOCCC entry?</h3>
<p>If you see a problem with an IOCCC entry, first check the <a
href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file. In some cases what you might think
of as a bug is instead a known feature. In some cases the bug is known,
but no fix has ever been submitted. In other cases you may have found a
new problem.</p>
<p>If you do have a fix, and the <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file
<strong>does not recommend against fixing it</strong>, then please
consider opening a <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull request</a>
against the master <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches">branch</a> of the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">ioccc-src/winner
repo</a>.</p>
<p>BTW: A <strong>problem</strong> is not limited to the code itself.
Fixing typos in files such as “<em>index.html</em>” files, fixing issues
in a “<em>Makefile</em>”, or otherwise correcting an IOCCC entry is
<strong>VERY MUCH WELCOME</strong>! Please use the same <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull request</a>
process against the master <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches">branch</a> of the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">ioccc-src/winner
repo</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: some of the issues in the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>
file includes just missing files and we welcome these too!</p>
<p><strong>Please also help us fix typos and / or otherwise improve the
write-up</strong> of how IOCCC winning entries are presented!</p>
<p>In any event we will happily add you to the <a
href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a> file for your help!</p>
<p>And of course, an IOCCC author may update their own entries (metadata
as well as source code and any extra files) by opening a <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull request</a>
against the master <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches">branch</a> of the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">ioccc-src/winner

<p>Note that we’re much more inclined to accept an author’s fixes but
the judges have the final say in the matter.</p>

5.5: How may I correct or update IOCCC author information?</h2>
<p>Authors of IOCCC winning entries are kept in JSON files of the
form:</p>
<pre><code>author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>where <em>author_handle</em> is an author handle. See <a
href="#author_handle">FAQ 6.5</a> for more information about an author
handles.</p>
<p>The contents of these JSON files contain the best known information
about authors of IOCCC entries. See <a href="#author_json">FAQ 6.6</a>
for information about the contents of these JSON file and how they are
used.</p>
<p>You may update IOCCC author information in a
<code>author_handle.json</code> file by opening a <a

id="faq-5.6-what-should-i-do-if-i-find-a-broken-or-wrong-web-link"><a name="faq5_6"></a><a name="fix_link"></a>FAQ
5.6: What should I do if I find a broken or wrong web link?</h2>
<p>We would appreciate if you try to fix the broken (the link goes
nowhere) or wrong (the link goes to something that clearly is not the
original intent) web link. If wish to fix such links, you may open a
GitHub pull request as described in <a href="#fix_web_site">FAQ 5.4</a>.
In the case of dead links or invalid links it doesn’t matter if it’s a
specific winner or not; the procedure is the same: open a pull request
to fix the problem.</p>
<p>As far as how to find the updated link you can try using the <a
href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> and see if
you can find the last non 4xx non 3xx page. Note, however, that just
because it redirects, does not mean it’s not valuable. Other times you
might find it with a web search.</p>
<p>Some links were changed to more recent URLs by doing this exact same
thing. Some links, while they were a valid web page, no longer reach the
intended web page (for example when the domain is sold and the new
domain owner’s content no longer provides the content that was
originally intended .. and while the content of the web page may be
humorous to some, the original content may have literally gone “up in
smoke”).</p>
<p>In cases where the original content is lost, try searching for it on
the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a>. When
searching look back for dates that are around the year of given IOCCC
contest. If you do find the original content in Internet archive
history, please consider submitting a change to replace the link
accordingly.</p>
<p>If there is no alternative that you can find you might want to remove
the link instead by replacing the link with just phrase of text. For
example, if the text in some <code>index.html</code> file was:</p>
<pre><code>See the [author&#39;s description of the program](https://example.com) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that the author’s description cannot be found in the <a
href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> archive,
then replace that text with:</p>
<pre><code>See the **author&#39;s description of the program** (sorry the content is no longer available) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>If you just wish to report the bad link issue, see <a
href="#report_web_problem">FAQ 5.3</a>.</p>

6.0: How did an entry that breaks the size rule 2 win the IOCCC?</h3>
<p>As entries have been fixed it is entirely possible that some of the
entries no longer fit within the year’s size restrictions. Invariably
the length of columns and/or number of rows have also changed.</p>
<p>The <code>winner.orig.c</code> file contains the original source code
that was subjected to rule 2 of the given IOCCC. You may also wish to
see the <a href="archive">/archive</a> directory where you can find all
the original winning entries as compressed tar files for a given
year.</p>
<p>In some cases the entry may have abused rule 2 and declared an “abuse
of the rules” (although now blatant abuse of the rules to get around
rule 2 size limits is discouraged).</p>

<p>Yes! Please see <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> for a list of known
bugs and/or issues of a variety of kinds.</p>
<p>Note that just because an entry is not in the bugs file does not mean
there is not an issue and note that some issues are simply missing

<h3
id="faq-6.4-why-do-you-sometimes-use-the-first-person-plural"><a name="faq6_4"></a>FAQ
6.4: Why do you sometimes use the first person plural?</h3>
<p>As a precedent for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism">first person plural</a>, we
may sight <a
href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.35.1442">Two-,
Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects in bcc in 3He</a> and the
co-authorship of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard">F. D. C.
Willard</a> as well as the <a
href="https://journals.aps.org/2014/04/01/aps-announces-a-new-open-access-initiative">APS
New Open Access Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>The number of <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC
judges</a> has always been “&gt; 1” such that IOCCC judges often prefer
to themselves in the plural, sometimes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural">in the common plural</a>,
sometimes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism">first
person plural</a>, there may be some who reject such a practice.
Therefore please consider that when you believe that just one of the <a
href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> is in action, you may consider
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard">F. D. C.
Willard</a> has been consulted, agreed, and has authorized the statement
thus allowing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural">in the
common plural</a> to be used without offense.</p>
<p>And while some might claim that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard">F. D. C.
Willard</a> died in 1982, we suggest that the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_cat">Schrödinger’s
cat</a> superposition may still be in effect and the 1982 <a

id="faq-6.5-what-is-an-author-handle"><a name="faq6_5"></a><a name="author_handle"></a>FAQ
6.5: What is an author handle?</h3>
<p>An <code>author_handle</code> is string that refers to a given author
and is unique to the IOCCC. Each author has exactly one
<code>author_handle</code>.</p>
<p>For each <code>author_handle</code>, there will be a JSON file of the
form:</p>
<pre><code>author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="#author_json">FAQ 6.6</a> for information about the
contents of these JSON file and how they are used.</p>
<p>Because the <code>author_handle</code> is used to form a JSON
filename, the string must be POSIX safe string. Furthermore, the
<code>author_handle</code> must be an ASCII string that matches this
regexp:</p>
<pre class="re"><code>^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z_]*$</code></pre>
<p>Default <code>author_handle</code>’s do not have multiple consecutive
<code>_</code> (underscore) characters. Nevertheless, multiple
consecutive <code>_</code> (underscore) characters are allowed. Contest
submitters who wish to override their default <code>author_handle</code>
may do so.</p>
<p>The <code>author_handle</code> is derived from the name of the
author. While there is a algorithm that maps the name of the author
(which can contain any UTF-8 characters) into a default
<code>author_handle</code> string, those who submit an entry to the
IOCCC are free to choose a different <code>author_handle</code> string
if they so desire.</p>
<p>An <code>author</code> who has won a previous IOCCC is encouraged to
reuse their <code>author_handle</code> so that new winning entries can
be associated with the same author.</p>
<p>For an anonymous <code>author</code>, their handle is one of these
forms:</p>
<pre><code>Anonymous_year</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>Anonymous_year.digits</code></pre>
<p>The latter form is in case there are more than one anonymous author
in a given year.</p>
<p>NOTE: even if the directory name is not <code>anonymous</code> the
above rules apply as in in the case of <a
href="2005/anon/anon.c">2005/anon</a>.</p>
<p>Anonymous <code>author_handle</code>’s match this regexp:</p>
<pre class="re"><code>Anonymous_[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][.0-9]*$</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="#fix_author">FAQ 5.5</a> for information about how to
update and/or correct IOCCC author information.</p>
<h3
id="faq-6.6-what-is-a-author_handle.json-file-and-how-are-they-used"><a name="faq6_6"></a><a name="author_json"></a>FAQ
6.6: What is a author_handle.json file and how are they used?</h3>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: The contents of these JSON files contain the
best known information about authors of IOCCC entries and is used to
help form HTML files as well to contact an author.</p>
<p>The content of these JSON files are used by tools from a <a
href="bin/index.html">bin directory tool</a> to help build HTML content
for the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web site</a>. For
example, the <code>index.html</code> file for each IOCCC entry contains
selected information about the authors. Tools from the <a
href="bin/index.html">bin directory</a> use the content of these JSON
files to generate the <code>index.html</code> files for each IOCCC
winning entry.</p>
<p>Moreover, should the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> need to
contact an authors of a IOCCC entry, they will consult the contents of
the author’s JSON file for ways to contact them.</p>
<p>Each author of an IOCCC winning entry has their own
<code>author_handle.json</code> file of the form:</p>
<pre><code>author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>where <em>author_handle</em> is an author handle. See <a
href="#author_handle">FAQ 6.5</a> for more information about an author
handles.</p>
<h4 id="author_handle.json-json-file-contents">author_handle.json JSON
file contents</h4>
<p>The syntax of a <code>author_handle.json</code> follows the
<em>So-called JSON spec</em>. See <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/jparse/json_index.html#so_called_json_spec">json_index.html</a>
for information on the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the JSON file contents of a
<code>author_handle.json</code> file is to look at an example, the
<code>author_handle.json</code> file for Yusuke Endoh:</p>
<pre><code>author/Yusuke_Endoh.json</code></pre>

<p>Because the authors of the so-called JSON spec removed the ability to
use comments in JSON (for reason(s) that seem to be less than credible),
the IOCCC mandates this <em>JSON member</em> be present in all IOCCC
related JSON files.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>no_comment</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em>
<strong>MUST</strong> be the exact <em>JSON string</em> as shown
above.</p>
<h5 id="author_json_format_version">author_JSON_format_version</h5>

<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the format version of the
<code>author_handle.json</code> JSON file.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>author_JSON_format_version</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the
<em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> the version of the contents! When
updating an <code>author_handle.json</code> JSON file, <strong>DO NOT
MODIFY author_JSON_format_version</strong>! As of <em>Thu Nov 30
23:51:12 UTC 2023</em>, the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be
<em>“1.0 2023-06-10”</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>author_JSON_format_version</em> would only changed when the
overall format of the these files is modified: and then only those who
maintain the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web site</a>
would be the one to do this in conjunction with changes to <a
href="bin/index.html">bin directory tools</a>.</p>
<h5 id="author_handle">author_handle</h5>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb73"><pre

<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the author handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>author_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON
value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> that is also
a value author handle.</p>
<p>See <a href="#author_handle">FAQ 6.5</a> for more information about
an author handles.</p>
<p>Normally the <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> should
<strong>NOT</strong> be changed <strong>unless there is a strong reason
to do so</strong>. If the <em>JSON value</em> changes, then all of the
<code>.entry.json</code> files for all of this authors winning IOCCC
entries should also be changed. The <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON
value</em> must match the basename (without the leading path and without
the trailing <code>.json</code>) of the <code>author_handle.json</code>
file. So a change of <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> would
also require the <code>author_handle.json</code> file to also be
renamed.</p>

<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the full name of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>full_name</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em>
<strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The full name of an author may use non-ASCII characters so long as

<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the string that will be used to sort
the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em>
<strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>. Moreover the string
<strong>MUST</strong> be a lower case ASCII alphanumeric string that
starts with a lower case ASCII letter.</p>
<p>The <em>JSON value</em> is used, for example, to place a reference to
the author in the <code>/authors.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Normally the <code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> <em>JSON
value</em> is the last name of the author, translated into lower case
ASCII alphanumeric string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter. If
the author wishes to be found in the <code>/authors.html</code> file
under a different string, such as if they wish to be listed under their
first name or their username, then they may change this accordingly.</p>

<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one

string <strong>MUST</strong> be 2 character UPPER case ASCII alphabetic
string that is <strong>NOT</strong> an Unassigned <a

3166-1 alpha-2 code</a> value (not a 2 character symbol with a gray
background on that Wikipedia table)</p>
<p>The <code>soup/location</code> tool from the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>,
when run without arguments, will print the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes that
permitted, along with the location name.</p>
<p>We use the term “location” (and not “country”) because some of the
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes belong to locations that are not technically a
country, such as “Antarctica” or a User-assigned code.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify a location, they should select
<strong>XX</strong>.</p>

<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the email
address is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb78"><pre

<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>url</code>
<em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON
null</em>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the URL

<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>url</code>
<em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON
null</em>.</p>
<p>In some cases the author may wish to record a special URL for their
IOCCC entry, or a 2nd URL such as a work or school or personal home
page. For example, Cody as of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em>
used:</p>

<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the
alternate URL is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb83"><pre

<h5 id="deprecated_twitter_handle">deprecated_twitter_handle</h5>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> used to hold the twitter handle of the
author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the
<em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> or
it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>The IOCCC no longer is associated with twitter (or whatever someone
chooses to call it), and so the <code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code>
is <strong>no longer used</strong>. A <em>JSON value</em> that is not a
<em>JSON null</em> is kept for only historic reasons. For example,
Anthony C. Howe once used:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb84"><pre

<p>If the author wishes to not specify an twitter handle, or if the
twitter handle is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>

be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON
null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em> just be a valid Mastodon handle. In
particular is must start with an at sign (<em><span class="citation"

by the author.</p>
<p>For more information in Mastodon, see the <a

<p>The IOCCC uses the Mastodon social network for announcements such as
the opening and closing of a new IOCCC, changes to the IOCCC web site,
updates during the judging process, and when new IOCCC entries are
selected. We recommend you follow us on Mastodon.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon handle, or if the
Mastodon handle is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as
the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>

<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>mastodon_url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON
value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> or it
<strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em>
just be a valid URL. If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON
null</em>, them the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be a
<em>JSON null</em>. If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON
string</em>, then the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be
a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>mastodon_url</code> is just a translation of the above
mentioned <a href="#mastodon">mastodon</a> handle. For example, if the
Mastodon handle is:</p>
<pre><code>@user@server.domain</code></pre>
<p>Then the <code>mastodon_url</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code>https://server.domain/@user</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon URL, or if the
Mastodon URL is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>

<p>The IOCCC uses GitHub to hold the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">official winner repo of the
IOCCC</a>, and hosts <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC web
site</a> on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>The IOCCC GitHub handle is:</p>
<pre><code>@ioccc-src</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an GitHub handle, or if the
GitHub handle is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb95"><pre
class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb95-1"><a href="#cb95-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="er">&quot;github&quot;</span> <span class="er">:</span> <span class="er">null,</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the affiliation of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one
<code>affiliation</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON
value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> or it
<strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>An affiliation might be the name of a school, university, company, or
organization. It is recommended that the affiliation <em>JSON
string</em> be the formal affiliation name. For example, the affiliation
for the IOCCC would be:</p>
<pre><code>The International Obfuscared C Code Contest</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an affiliation, or if the
affiliation is unknown, they should use the <em>JSON null</em> as the
<em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb98"><pre

6.7: What is a entry_id?</h3>
<p>A <code>entry_id</code> is a string that identifies a winning entry
of the IOCCC.</p>
<p>A <code>entry_id</code> is a 4-digit year, followed by an underscore,
followed by a directory name.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>entry_id</code> associated with Cody Boone
Ferguson’s 2nd winning IOCCC entry of 2020 is found under the following
directory:</p>
<pre><code>2020/ferguson2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>entry_id</code> for that winning entry is:</p>

6.8: What is the purpose of the .top, .year and .path files?</h3>
<p>The <a href=".top">.top</a> file resides at the top directory. This
file contains the complete list of IOCCC years.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC year. one will find a <code>.year</code> file. These
files contain directory paths from the top directory, of the IOCCC entry
directories for a given year. For example, see the <a
href=".1984/.year">1984/.year</a> file.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC entry directory, you will find a <code>.path</code>
file. These files contain the directory path from the top directory. For
example see <a href="1984/anonymous/.path">1984/anonymous/.path</a>.</p>
<p>The .top, .year and .path files are generated from the top level
Makefile, by:</p>

6.9: What is the current meaning of the IOCCC terms Author, Entry, and
Submission?</h3>
<p>The IOCCC is now attempting to use the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>author</em> is someone who has submitted an entry that has won
the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An entry can have more than one authors. A number of authors have
submitted entries that have won the IOCCC, sometimes in the same IOCCC
contest year.</p>
<p><strong>An apology for being inconsistent</strong>: In the past, the
IOCCC used the term <em>winner</em> to refer to what is now an
<em>author</em>. In a number of historical cases, such as old rules and
old guidelines, terms such as <em>winner</em> may still be found.
Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old names such as
<em>winner</em> when they should use <em>author</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)!
:-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>entry</em> is a submission that won the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> has one or more <em>authors</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> includes all of the files needed to compile it,
plus sample input files, a <code>Makefile</code>, an
<code>.entry.json</code> file describing the entry, a compressed tarball
containing all of files in the entry, etc. Under the IOCCC tree, an
<em>entry</em> that win the IOCCC in year <em>YYYY</em> is located under
the directory <code>YYYY/entry</code>.</p>
<p><strong>An apology for being inconsistent</strong>: In the past, the
IOCCC used the term <em>winner</em> to refer to what is now an

<em>winner</em> when they should use <em>entry</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)!
:-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>submission</em> is something given to the IOCCC judges for
consideration when the IOCCC is open.</p>
<p>When the IOCCC is open for submissions, those who register to enter
the IOCCC may use the <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry tool</a>
to package their code into a compressed tarball that may be uploaded to
the <a href="https://submit.ioccc.org">IOCCC submit server</a>. This
compressed tarball is formatted in such a way that the IOCCC judges do
not see who wrote the code.</p>
<p>A <em>submission</em> that the IOCCC judges deem to have won the
IOCCC becomes an <em>entry</em>. Only then do the IOCCC judges look into
the special JSON file to discover who the <em>author</em>(s) are.</p>

6.10: How does someone make a change to a file and submit that change as
a GitHub pull request?</h3>
<p>First, if you do not already have a GitHub account or you have not
installed an ssh key to your account you must do so. For this we will
assume you do not have a GitHub account. For the steps following
creating a GitHub account you will have to be logged into your
account.</p>
<p>To help you out here is a navigation menu in this FAQ entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub
account</a></li>
<li><a href="#installing-an-ssh-key">Installing an ssh key to
GitHub</a></li>

<li><a href="#what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a

</ul>
<h4 id="creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub account</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and click on ‘Sign
up’. Follow the instructions. Once you’ve completed this task make sure
you log in to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="installing-an-ssh-key-to-github">Installing an ssh key to
GitHub</h4>
<p>Assuming you do not have an ssh key you should go to the command
prompt and type (if you already have one and are okay using it for
GitHub you can use that one):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb103"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb103-1"><a href="#cb103-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ssh-keygen</span> <span class="at">-t</span> rsa <span class="at">-b</span> 4096 <span class="at">-C</span> <span class="st">&quot;luser@example.com&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>luser@example.com</code> is the email you want associated
with your key. Follow the instructions. It will tell you the key
files.</p>
<p>Once you have an ssh key you need to go to your <a
href="https://github.com/settings/profile">account settings</a>. Once
there, in the menu on the left you should see the item <em>SSH and GPG
keys</em>. Click that and then click (on the right side) the button that
says <em>New SSH key</em>. You will see that you have to specify a
title, the key type and the PUBLIC key. Put whatever title you want and
keep the key type as <em>Authentication Key</em>. Now you need to put
the PUBLIC key in.</p>
<p>If you used an rsa key the default file will likely be found in:
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. If you used a different algorithm the
file name will be different. For instance if you used
<code>ed25519</code> the default PUBLIC key file would be
<code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>. If, like some people do, you have a
separate key for GitHub, it could be anything you wish, as long as it’s
in <code>~/.ssh</code>. For instance it might be
<code>~/.ssh/github.pub</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever the key file is, copy the contents and paste it into the
GitHub field labelled <em>Key</em>. Once you have done so click on
<em>Add SSH key</em>.</p>
<h4 id="forking-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo">Forking the temp-test-ioccc
repo</h4>
<p>Open in your browser the link: <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/fork"
class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/fork</a>. You
now should follow the instructions in forking the repo.</p>
<h4 id="cloning-the-temp-test-ioccc-repo">Cloning the temp-test-ioccc
repo</h4>
<p>Once you have forked the repo you are ready to clone it to your
system. For instance Cody Boone Ferguson has the GitHub handle
<em>xexyl</em> so he would type in:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb104"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb104-1"><a href="#cb104-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> clone https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc <span class="pp">[</span><span class="ss">target_dir</span><span class="pp">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once that is completed you will need to change to that directory. The
default directory would be the name of the repo but if you specified a
target directory it will be that. For instance using the above example
you might do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb105"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb105-1"><a href="#cb105-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">cd</span> temp-test-ioccc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’re ready to make your changes now!</p>
<h4 id="making-changes-fixes-etc.">Making changes, fixes etc.</h4>
<p>Here you must use your wits, knowledge, creativity and whatever else
you have. Let’s say that Cody wants to update his file <a
href="2020/ferguson1/play.sh">/2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a> script. He
would open it in his editor of choice (in his case vim) and make the
changes. He would then make sure (as there is a last updated date) to
update the last updated date. For instance he might add the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BTW: did you know that some people believe in snake human hybrids?
It’s true! See http://www.macroevolution.net/snake-human-hybrids.html
and have a laugh, shock or an exercise in sibilance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, assuming that the date is 1 March 2024, he would update the
line that starts with <code># Last updated:</code> to refer to
<code>01 March 2024</code> rather than what it is now (at the time of
writing this), <code>15 April 2023</code>.</p>
<p>But what if he wanted to add a file? He’d create the file and then
type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb106"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb106-1"><a href="#cb106-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>where <em>foo</em> is the file to add.</p>
<p>When he’s ready to make a commit he would need to create a new branch
for the pull request.</p>
<h4 id="committing-your-changes">Committing your changes</h4>
<p>First, as an aside, if this is your first pull request (which we
assume is if you’re reading this :-) ) you need to make sure that you
can push changes to GitHub with your ssh key. To do this you need to
do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb107"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb107-1"><a href="#cb107-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ssh</span> <span class="at">-T</span> git@github.com</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Cody would see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi xexyl! You’ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
provide shell access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, assuming that the forked repo is <a
href="https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc"
class="uri">https://github.com/xexyl/temp-test-ioccc</a>, you’d
type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb108"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb108-1"><a href="#cb108-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> remote set-url origin git@github.com:xexyl/temp-test-ioccc.git</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now you’d be ready to make your commits.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else, however, a new branch needs to be
created. Continuing the example above for <a
href="2020/ferguson1/play.sh">2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a>, it might be
that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb109"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb109-1"><a href="#cb109-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout <span class="at">-B</span> human-snakes</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would change the branch to the newly created branch
<code>human-snakes</code> branch. Now Cody could commit the changes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb110"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb110-1"><a href="#cb110-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit play.sh <span class="co"># if specifying specific files</span></span>
<span id="cb110-2"><a href="#cb110-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit <span class="at">-a</span> <span class="co"># if committing everything</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>He could also have done:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb111"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb111-1"><a href="#cb111-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> add play.sh</span>
<span id="cb111-2"><a href="#cb111-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> commit</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In any case this would open an editor (in his case vim) to write a
commit log. It is recommended that the first line is &lt;=51 chars and
the next line is blank. Then if necessary add a description for the log.
For instance the above might warrant the log:</p>
<pre><code>Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh

Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</code></pre>
<p>Now a pull request has to be opened.</p>
<h4 id="opening-a-pull-request">Opening a pull request</h4>
<p>To do this depends on the branch name. Assuming the branch from
above, <code>human-snakes</code>, you would type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb113"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb113-1"><a href="#cb113-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> push <span class="at">--set-upstream</span> origin human-snakes</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This might show:</p>
<pre><code>Enumerating objects: 9, done.
Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.

branch &#39;human-snakes&#39; set up to track &#39;origin/human-snakes&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>The link referred to above would then be opened to open a pull
request. Just follow the instructions at this point. If however it does
not show a link it is likely because the branch already exists in your
GitHub account (for the repo). In this case you can open the link: <a
href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls"
class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls</a> which
might show something like:</p>
<pre><code>xexyl:human-snakes had recent pushes 1 minute ago</code></pre>
<p>and to the right of it you would see a button that says <em>Compare
&amp; pull request</em> which you could click on. Do that and follow the
instructions.</p>
<p>An important note is if you have more than one pull request opened
it’ll only show the branch name as the summary. You should in that case
copy paste the log you put in into the website. For instance the line
(on the website) <em>Add a title</em> could have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the text field that is labelled <em>Add a description</em>
would have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a
link to the script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve done this you should click on <em>Create pull
request</em>.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: although the <a
href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> will give more
deference to the authors of edited entries the <a
href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> also retain the
final editorial say in the matter.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a merge</h4>
<p>When the judges have merged the pull request you now need to make
sure your fork has the merge. To do this from the command line, assuming
the fork in the above example, you would type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb116"><pre
class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb116-1"><a href="#cb116-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> checkout master <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> pull https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc.git master <span class="kw">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> push origin master</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will merge your pull request to your fork.</p>
