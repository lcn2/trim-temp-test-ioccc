<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Please see our <a href="markdown.html">IOCCC markdown guide</a> for <strong>important information</strong> on using markdown in the IOCCC.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is <em>NOT</em> necessary to install the tools to use them as you can run
the tools from the top of the <code>mkiocccentry</code> repo directory just fine, though
you’ll have to use the form of <code>./mkiocccentry</code> instead of just <code>mkiocccentry</code>.
However, installing it will make it easier for you as you can run it from your
submission’s directory. See the
FAQ on “<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/FAQ.md#install">installing
mkiocccentry</a>”
at the mkiocccentry repo.</p>
<p>If the <code>mkiocccentry</code> tool indicates that there is a problem with your entry,
especially if it identifies a <a href="next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, or any other
rule, related problem, you are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged to revise and correct
your entry and then re-run the <code>mkiocccentry</code> tool.</p>
<p>If you choose to risk violating rules, be sure and explain your reason
for doing so in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.</p>
<p>See also <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>!</p>
<h4 id="upload-your-entry-to-the-ioccc-submit-server">5. Upload your entry to the IOCCC submit server</h4>
<p>The following steps should be taken, in order to upload your <code>mkiocccentry</code> xz
compressed tarball, to change the file (if you need to upload a different file
or you have updated the submission), and to check the status of it after the
contest closes:</p>
<p>First, open the web page in your browser. It should look like this:
With the login id and password already input, It should look something like
this:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-login.png"
 alt="submit server login screen"
 width=710 height=562></p>
<p>The login is the UUID you were provided when you registered for the IOCCC and
the password is the initial password you were provided with. Click “Login”.
Assuming everything is fine, it should look something like:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-first-login.png"
 alt="submit server password change required"
 width=710 height=808></p>
<p>As you can see, you have to change your password. Put in your login (UUID
username), your old (initial) password and a new password. For instance:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-change-passwd.png"
 alt="submit server changing password"
 width=710 height=808></p>
<p>Click “Change Password”.</p>
<p>Once this is done, you will have to log in again. Using the UUID login and the
new password:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-passwd-changed.png"
 alt="submit server password changed"
 width=710 height=344></p>
<p>.. click “Login”.</p>
<p>Once you’ve logged in, you will see submit slots. Each slot is for one
submission so if you update a submission, make sure you choose the right one so
you do not overwrite the wrong one!</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like without any uploads and no slot selected:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-slots.png"
 alt="submit server slots"
 width=710 height=806></p>
<p>Select a slot and then select a file by clicking the button “Choose File”. After
doing this, it should look something like:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-slot-file.png"
 alt="submit server slot and file selected"
 width=717 height=865></p>
<p>If you need to change the file to upload, you can mouseover the file and click
it. If you wait a moment it’ll show the current filename. It will look something
like this:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-change-file.png"
 alt="submit server change file"
 width=717 height=865></p>
<p>Once you’re certain you have selected the correct file, click “Submit”, below
the file selection step.</p>
<p>When it’s uploaded it should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-submission-uploaded.png"
 alt="submit server submission uploaded"
 width=717 height=525></p>
<p>Here you see the details, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>the status of the submission</li>
<li>the filename, which will be in the correct format, assuming you used
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> which is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended so that you do not break <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a>!</li>
<li>the file length, which <code>txzchk(1)</code> will also verify (the file itself and the
tarball listing)</li>
<li>the upload date</li>
<li>the SHA256 hash of the file</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if you’re done, log out.</p>
<p>After the submission deadline is reached, you can log in to check the status of
your submissions. Here is what it will look like when the judges have verified
that your tarball / submission has been validated (NOT judged), by <code>txzchk(1)</code>
and <code>chkentry(1)</code>.:</p>
<p><img src="png/submit-server-status-updated.png"
 alt="submit server status updated"
 width=717 height=217></p>
<p>For details on <code>txzchk</code>, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#txzchk">txzchk</a>”.</p>
<p>For details on <code>chkentry</code>, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#chkentry">chkentry</a>”.</p>
<p>If you need more information on what <code>chkentry</code> checks, see the

<p>This toolkit is from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry

<p>The <code>mkiocccentry</code> tool first gathers your source
code, your Makefile, your remarks, any other data files you wish to provide (up
to a maximum, including the mandatory files, defined in
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/soup/limit_ioccc.h">limit_ioccc.h</a>
as <code>MAX_FILE_COUNT</code>) and other information about your submission,
information about the author (or authors), and then runs a lot of tests before (if
all is OK) forming your tarball. After this is done it will additionally run the
<code>txzchk(1)</code> tool (which runs the <code>fnamchk(1)</code> tool) on the submission tarball.
The tool <code>chkentry(1)</code> will also be run, before creating the tarball. See the
FAQ on “<a href="#txzchk">txzchk</a>”,

<p>The below details discuss this very important tool. As it is complicated we will
explain how to use this tool. If you want to know what it is in simpler terms,
see the
FAQ on “<a href="#about_mkiocccentry">what mkiocccentry is</a>”.</p>
<p>As the <a href="next/guidelines.html">Guidelines</a> state, the synopsis is:</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry [options] work_dir prog.c \
         Makefile remarks.md [file ...]</code></pre>
<p>… where <code>work_dir</code> is a directory that will be used to build the submission
tarball, <code>prog.c</code> is your submission source code, <code>Makefile</code> is your submission’s
<code>Makefile</code>, <code>remarks.md</code> are your remarks (that will be the basis of the
<code>README.md</code> file which will be used to form the <code>index.html</code> file, if your
submission wins) and the remaining args are the paths to any other files you
wish to submit.</p>
<p>The <code>work_dir</code> <strong>MUST</strong> already exist, as a directory, and it is an error if it
is not a directory that can be written to. In <strong>this</strong> directory your <strong>submission
directory</strong> will be created, with the name based on your IOCCC registration
username, which is <strong>in the form of a UUID</strong>, and submission number; see the
<a href="next/rules.html">rules</a> for more details on this, and in particular <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a>.</p>
<p>If the <strong><em>subdirectory</em> in the <em>work directory</em></strong> already exists, you will have to
move it, remove it or otherwise specify a different work directory (<strong>NOT</strong> the
subdirectory), as it needs to be empty and the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool does not
check this for you as it could not do anything about anyway.</p>

<h3 id="q-0.3-what-should-i-put-in-my-submission-makefile">Q 0.3: What should I put in my submission Makefile?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>We recommend starting with the <a href="next/Makefile.example">sample
Makefile</a>
(renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course) as a starting point for your
entry’s <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/next/Makefile.example">view example Makefile</a></li>
<li><a href="next/Makefile.example">Makefile.example</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> is a file used by the <code>make(1)</code> command that contains
rules and UNIX shell-style commands.</p>
<p>The first and default rule should be the <code>all</code> rule and should build your
entry’s executable file. There are other rules that should be present in your
Makefile, and which mkiocccentry attempts to find; see below.</p>
<p>If your entry depends on a particular source file name during compilation or execution,
your <code>Makefile</code> should copy <code>prog.c</code> into the desired filename. See the
FAQ on “<a href="#prog_c">source and compiled filenames</a>”
for an example.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar <code>Makefile</code>s, you might consider the following tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction">GNU make</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile">What is a Makefile and how does it work?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://makefiletutorial.com">Learn Makefiles</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the <code>make(1)</code> <em>connoisseur</em>: As of 2023, IOCCC judges use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU
make compatible</a> <code>make(1)</code>
command that is compatible with GNU Make version 3.81. Your Makefile should be
compatible with this; see the
FAQ on “<a href="#gmake">Makefile compatibility</a>”
for more details and help.</p>
<h4 id="expected-make-rules">Expected <code>make</code> rules:</h4>
<p>The following rules should exist in your Makefile:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>all</code>
<ul>
<li>This rule should be the first rule and it should compile your submission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>clean</code>
<ul>
<li>This rule should remove any intermediate build files, for example <code>.o</code>
files or other intermediate build files. It should <strong>NOT</strong> remove compiled
programs (see <code>clobber</code> below).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>clobber</code>
<ul>
<li>This rule should restore the original state of the submission’s directory.
It should depend on the <code>clean</code> rule and it should remove the compiled
program(s), clean up any files made by the program etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>try</code>
<ul>
<li>run the program in a way you suggest. If you use the <code>try.sh</code> script
system, which we do like, you can have this rule invoke the script
(<code>./try.sh</code>). See the
FAQ on the “<a href="#try_scripts">try.sh scripts system</a>”
for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Although the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool only checks for those rules, the most up to
date
<code>Makefile.example</code>
does have other rules like <code>everything</code> and <code>alt</code>, and we encourage you to use
the one linked to above.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, <strong>PLEASE</strong> read the <a href="markdown.html">IOCCC markdown guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Next, while you may put in as much or as little as you wish into your entry’s
<code>remarks.md</code> file, we do have few important suggestions:</p>
<p>We recommend that you explain how to use your entry. Explain the
command line (if any command line options and arguments are used)
and any input or actions if applicable.</p>
<p>We highly recommend that you explain why you think your entry is
well obfuscated.</p>
<p>For those entries that win the IOCCC, we often use much of text from the
<code>remarks.md</code> file in the <em>Author’s remarks</em> section of the <code>index.html</code> file.
For this reason, a well written <code>remarks.md</code> file is considered a plus.</p>
<p>While not required, consider adding bit of humor to your <code>remarks.md</code>
as most people who are not humor impaired, as well as the IOCCC judges
appreciate the opportunity for a fun read as well as a chuckle or two.</p>
<h4 id="what-helps">What helps:</h4>
<ul>
<li>explaining what your entry does</li>
<li>how to entice it to do what it is supposed to do</li>
<li>what obfuscations are used</li>
<li>what are the limitations of your entry in respect of portability and/or input data</li>
<li>how it works (if you are really condescending)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-not-help">What does not help:</h4>
<ul>
<li>admitting that your entry is not very obfuscated (you see, the contest is
called the <strong>IOCCC</strong>, not the <strong>INVOCCC</strong> :-) ); but even if you do not admit
it, not very obfuscated entries have a minuscule chance to win (although
<a href="2000/tomx/index.html">2000/tomx</a> is a notable counterexample).</li>
<li>mentioning your name or any identifying information in the remark section (or
in the C code for that matter) - we like to be unbiased during the judging
rounds; we look at the author name only if an entry wins. See the guidelines if
this is not clear!</li>
<li>leaving the remark section empty.</li>

</div>
<p>If your submission has more than one use, or if you have interesting ways to
invoke your program, perhaps using other commonly installed tools (or tools
included in your submission), it can be helpful to include a <code>try.sh</code> script:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/next/try.sh">view example try.sh</a></li>
<li><a href="next/try.sh">download example try.sh</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/next/try.alt.sh">view example try.alt.sh</a></li>
<li><a href="next/try.alt.sh">download example try.alt.sh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The template <code>try.sh</code> script can be used as a starting point, or you can look at
some of the others in past winning entries, to get some ideas.</p>
<p>It is not detrimental to your chances of winning if you do not include one as
not all submissions can make use of them. Nevertheless, it is helpful to include
ways to use your program and as submitted Makefiles should have a <code>try</code> rule, if
you have creative ways this can be a bonus. It does not mean that a program that
cannot be used with other programs is less interesting or less likely to win,
but we do enjoy interesting and creative uses of submissions.</p>
<p>If you have alternate code that you are including, then you can use the
<code>try.alt.sh</code> template as well.</p>
<p>We recommend that you include the use of these scripts in the <code>try</code> rule in the
example Makefile that you modify for your submission. See the
FAQ on “<a href="#makefile">submission Makefiles</a>.</p>

</div>
<p><code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> has some options to help write <em>OR</em> read from an
answers file so you do not have to input the author(s) or the submission
details (like the abstract, summary etc.), just to change a file.</p>
<p>To write to <code>answers.txt</code> try:</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry -a answers.txt ...</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you wish to overwrite a file, you can use the <code>-A</code>
flag with the same option argument. Be <strong>very careful</strong> that you do not accidentally
overwrite your <code>prog.c</code> or some other important file!</p>
<p>To make use of the answers file, use the <code>-i answers</code> option like:</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry -i answers.txt ...</code></pre>

</div>
<p>While your submission’s source filename, as submitted, must be <code>prog.c</code>, your entry’s <code>Makefile</code>
may copy <code>prog.c</code> to a different filename as part of the compiling/building process. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    # Makefile continues above ...

    all: desired_name

    desired_name: desired_name.c
            rm -f $@
            cc desired_name.c -o $@

    desired_name.c: prog.c
            rm -f $@
            cp -f prog.c $@

    clean:
            rm -f desired_name.o

    clobber: clean
            rm -f desired_name.c desired_name

    # Makefile continues below ...</code></pre>
<p>We recommend that the <code>make clobber</code> rule remove files that your entry
creates as part of the compiling/building process.</p>
<p>You may also copy the compiled <code>prog</code> into a different file as part of compiling process.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    # Makefile continues above ...

    all: desired_name

    different_name: prog
            rm -f $@
            cp -f prog $@

    clean:
            rm -f prog.o

</div>
<p>The IOCCC makes extensive use of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.
For example, when <a href="#submit">submitting to the IOCCC</a>, we have people
submit remarks about entry in markdown format. Every
<a href="years.html">winning IOCCC entry</a> uses a <code>README.md</code> markdown file
as the basis for forming the <code>index.html</code> web page for that entry.
All generated HTML pages on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC website</a>
start with some markdown content.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Please read the <a href="markdown.html">IOCCC markdown guidelines</a>
as it lists things you <strong>should NOT use</strong> in markdown files and things you
<strong>should do</strong> as well.</p>

<p>Chances are, if you have a question, there are a number of other people who
have similar questions. So we recommend that you first view the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/discussions">GitHub discussions for this repo</a>
to see if someone else asked it already. Feel free to join in on such a discussion,
even if to just say:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There are unfortunately some warnings that cannot be disabled; they are always
enabled whatever warning options you have enabled. Also, there is a warning that
is enabled whenever you act on <code>char *</code>s, saying it is unsafe buffer usage, even
when it’s not. This might be enabled by <code>-Weverything</code> but it might not be; for
more details on why we use <code>-Weverything</code> in Clang see the
FAQ on “<a href="#weverything">-Weverything</a>”.</p>
<p>It is not detrimental to your submission if you disable this, which you can do
by specifying <code>-Wno-unsafe-buffer-usage</code>.</p>
<p>So in short, no you should not worry about these as they are sometimes
inevitable in obfuscated code and even non-obfuscated code.</p>
<p>If you <em>can</em> work past this it might be good but this is not something that
should be worried about too much as this is on the compiler developers, not you.</p>

submission on a frequently submitted theme will have to do something
in a <strong>really unique AND interesting way</strong> to even make it into the
final judging rounds. It will have to compete with previous IOCCC
winners based on the same theme.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT HINT</strong>: If you really wish send in a submission on a
frequently submitted theme, be sure that it is obfuscated in several
new and novel ways.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT HINT</strong>: Be sure to <strong>clearly explain</strong> near the beginning
of your <code>remarks.md</code> file, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#remarks_md">remarks.md</a>”,

<p>While it is possible to win a new IOCCC with one of these
<strong>frequently submitted</strong> types of entries, level of the competition from
previous IOCCC entries make it more challenging to be successful.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the <a href="next/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> often
state something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tend to dislike programs that: are similar to previous winning entries.</p>

<p><strong>FAIR WARNING</strong>: Be sure to <strong>clearly explain</strong> near the beginning
of your <code>remarks.md</code> file, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#remarks_md">remarks.md</a>”,
<strong>why you are submitting an entry based on a frequently
submitted theme</strong> and <strong>how compares with previous IOCCC winners</strong>

<p>As entries have been fixed it is entirely possible that some of the entries no

the <a href="archive">archive</a> directory where you can find all the

<p>In some cases the entry may have abused rule 2 and declared an
“abuse of the rules” (although now blatant abuse of the rules to

<p>It takes a fair amount of time to setup, run, respond to messages, process entries,
review entries, trim down the set entries to a set of winning entries, doing the
write-up of the entries, announcing the entries, reviewing final edits of the
winning entry set, posting the winning entries, being flamed :-), tell folks who send in
late entries to wait until the next contest, etc… It takes a few weekends and
a number nights of study and work … which is hard given that we are busy with
many other activities as well.</p>
<p>Note that we do not contact the author if an entry does not compile or does not
work as advertised; we might attempt to fix obvious compilation problems or
incompatibilities, but no more than that - so be sure that your entry does work
on at least a couple different platforms, at least one of them being UNIX or
SUS-conforming. See the

<p>Are you trying to trick us? :-)</p>
<p>By tradition, we do not say how many judging rounds we have in a given IOCCC.</p>
<p>We often report when the IOCCC judges start the 1st round, and then usually
report when the IOCCC judges start near final judging rounds, and sometimes we
also report when we enter what we believe is the final judging round, so you may
guess that we have at least 3 rounds. :-) The actual number of rounds is
certainly more than 3.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In some years, the IOCCC judges discover a truly amazing IOCCC entry that
stands out among all of the other IOCCC entries received that year.
For such an IOCCC entry, the IOCCC judges award a “<code>Grand Prize</code>”
or “<code>Best of Show award</code>”.</p>
<p>In 1984-1987, the “<code>Grand Prize</code>” winning entries are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a></li>
<li><a href="1985/shapiro/index.html">1985/shapiro</a></li>

<li><a href="1987/lievaart/index.html">1987/lievaart</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from 1988, the entry we liked the most in that year is called
“<code>Best of Show</code>”. Here are the “<code>Best of Show</code>” entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="1988/applin/index.html">1988/applin</a></li>
<li><a href="1989/jar.2/index.html">1989/jar.2</a></li>

<li><a href="2020/carlini/index.html">2020/carlini</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In 1993, 1994 and 1995 the judges were unable to select a clear overall
winning entry. So to give a nod to the entry that had the highest approval ranking
from the judges, they used the following awards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="1993/rince/index.html">1993/rince</a> - <code>Most Well Rounded</code></li>
<li><a href="1994/shapiro/index.html">1994/shapiro</a> - <code>Most Well Rounded</code></li>
<li><a href="1995/leo/index.html">1995/leo</a> - <code>Best Use of Obfuscation</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These could be considered the ‘<code>best entry</code>’ for those years with 1 or
more other entries that came in close behind.</p>

<p>Although the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool will verify everything for you, you may wish
to validate different parts individually with the different tools. As the

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The tool that validates submission tarballs can be obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">IOCCC
mkiocccentry repo</a>. The
<code>mkiocccentry</code> tool itself will run the validator <strong>after</strong> forming the tarball.
However, you may wish to manually validate the tarball. The tool that does this
is <code>txzchk</code>.</p>
<p>If you wish to validate the tarball without running the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool,
for instance the tarball
<code>submit.12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab-2.1720636351.txz</code> you can, after
installing the tools, do:</p>
<pre><code>    txzchk submit.12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab-2.1720636351.txz</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that the tarball exists and is valid, you should see no output.</p>
<p>If you wish to see the contents, for instance like <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> does, you
could do:</p>
<pre><code>    txzchk -v 1 submit.12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab-2.1720636351.txz</code></pre>
<p>As the <a href="next/guidelines.html#txzchk">guidelines state</a>, it is beyond the scope
of this document to discuss the many tests that <code>txzchk(1)</code> runs; if you must
know we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/txzchk.c">source

<p>This tool, which is in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry

<p>Rather than <code>mkiocccentry</code> running this tool manually, <code>txzchk</code>’s algorithm uses
the output of this tool. If you wish to validate your tarball filename manually,
you can do so. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>    fnamchk submit.12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab-2.1720636351.txz</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<p>If you want to validate the <code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code> files you
should use <code>chkentry(1)</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry
repo</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>chkentry(1)</code> tool uses the IOCCC version of the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/jparse/man/man3/jparse.3">jparse
API</a>
to perform <strong>additional</strong> checks on these two IOCCC specific JSON files. It is
<em>possible</em> that this version will at times differ from the <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/man/man3/jparse.3">official jparse
API</a> at the
<a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">official jparse repo</a> and this is one of the
reasons the tools’ <code>-V</code> (version option) show the JSON parser version as well.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#auth_json">.auth.json</a>”
and
FAQ on “<a href="#info_json">.info.json</a>”
for more details on these files.</p>
<p>The <code>chkentry(1)</code> tool accepts more than one command line form.
If you pass a single argument, it is expected to be a directory that has both
<code>.auth.json</code> and <code>.info.json</code> in it. You can also specify a <code>.auth.json</code> and/or
<code>.info.json</code> file. An argument of “<code>.</code>” will skip that file. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>    # test entry directory test_work:
    chkentry test_work

    # run checks on .info.json:
    chkentry .info.json .

    # run checks on .auth.json:
    chkentry . .auth.json

    # run checks on .info.json and .auth.json:
    chkentry .info.json .auth.json</code></pre>
<p>If there is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> issue detected by the
<code>jparse(3)</code> API, then there is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> error and
<code>chkentry(1)</code> will report it as an <strong>error</strong>. If the parsing is OK (i.e. valid
JSON) but there is an issue in one or both of the
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> files in <strong>the context of the IOCCC</strong>,
it will report this as an <strong>error</strong>. Thus, if you were to package your
submission manually then you would be violating <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a>.</p>

<p>This file will be verified with the <code>chkentry(1)</code> tool and if there are any
problems <strong>it is an error</strong>. If there is an error the tarball will <strong>NOT</strong> be
formed by <code>mkiocccentry</code>; otherwise the <code>txzchk(1)</code> tool will be executed on the
tarball.</p>
<p>This file will <strong>NOT</strong> be looked at unless the submission wins! Nonetheless,
<code>chkentry(1)</code> <strong>WILL BE</strong> used on the file as part of the judging process.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, if your <code>.auth.json</code> file is invalid JSON or
is reported invalid by <code>chkentry</code> your submission will almost certainly be
rejected for violating the <a href="next/rules.html">Rules</a> and in particular <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a>.</p>
<p>An obvious example where <code>chkentry</code> would fail to validate <code>.auth.json</code> is if
there is a mismatch of type in the JSON file with what is expected, for
instance, if in <code>.auth.json</code> the <code>no_comment</code> that we chose to not comment on is
not a string. Another obvious example is when things are out of range (see above
for list). Two more examples would be if a field is missing or if an unknown
filed is in the file. In these cases (and any others that must be established as
valid by <code>chkentry</code>) your submission would be rejected for violating <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a> and in particular because <code>chkentry</code> would not
validate the <code>.auth.json</code> file.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> if you provide to <code>mkiocccentry</code> a different filename it will be
copied to <code>prog.c</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Makefile</code> (double quoted string)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <code>MUST</code> be <code>"Makefile"</code>, defined as <code>MAKEFILE_FILENAME</code> in

</ul>
<p>The <code>manifest</code> <strong>array</strong> also <strong>OPTIONALLY</strong> has one or more of the field:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>extra_file</code> (double quoted string)</p>
<ul>
<li>Any additional file that you need or want to include with your submission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this MUST <strong>NOT</strong> match a mandatory filename (see above list) and
<code>chkentry</code> will verify this for you; it is <strong>ALSO</strong> an <strong>error</strong> if the
filenames are not unique. In these cases you stand a great risk of having
your submission rejected for violating <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>! On
the other hand, <strong>ONLY</strong> <code>mkiocccentry</code> will verify that the files exist and
can be read; <code>txzchk(1)</code> will <strong>NOT</strong> do this for you as it only <strong>LISTS</strong>
the tarball: it does <strong>NOT</strong> extract it. Even so, the <a href="judges.html">Judges</a>
<strong>WILL</strong> extract the tarball and if a file listed in the manifest does not
exist your submission will very likely be rejected for not being as
documented!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, after the <code>manifest</code> <strong>array</strong>, the following fields <strong>MUST</strong> exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>formed_timestamp</code> (number)</p>
<ul>
<li>Seconds since epoch when JSON (<code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code>) file was formed (see <code>gettimeofday(2)</code>).</li>

in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/">mkiocccentry repo</a>). If
this is not the case your submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected.</p></li>
<li><p><code>formed_timestamp_usec</code> (number)</p>
<ul>
<li>Microseconds since the tstamp (seconds since epoch when <code>.auth.json</code> was
formed - see <code>gettimeofday(2)</code>) second.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this <strong>MUST</strong> be within the range <code>MIN_FORMED_TIMESTAMP_USEC</code>
<strong>THROUGH</strong> <code>MAX_FORMED_TIMESTAMP_USEC</code> and is validated by
<code>test_formed_timestamp_usec()</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/soup/entry_util.c">soup/entry_util.c</a>
in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/">mkiocccentry repo</a>. If
this is not the case <code>chkentry(1)</code> will report an <strong>error</strong> and your
submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected!</p></li>
<li><p><code>timestamp_epoch</code> (double quoted string)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 UTC"</code> (<code>gettimeofday(2)</code> epoch).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this <strong>MUST</strong> be <code>"Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 UTC"</code> which is <code>#define</code>d
as <code>TIMESTAMP_EPOCH</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/soup/limit_ioccc.h">soup/limit_ioccc.h</a>
in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/">mkiocccentry repo</a>. If
this is not the case your submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected!</p></li>
<li><p><code>min_timestamp</code> (number)</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum number of second since epoch for <strong>this</strong> IOCCC.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this <strong>MUST</strong> be &gt;= <code>MIN_TIMESTAMP</code> defined in
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/soup/limit_ioccc.h">soup/limit_ioccc.h</a>

this is not the case your submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This file will be verified with the <code>chkentry(1)</code> tool and if there are any
problems <strong>it is an error</strong> and the tarball will <strong>NOT</strong> be formed by
<code>mkiocccentry</code>; otherwise the <code>txzchk(1)</code> tool will be executed on the tarball.</p>
<p>The <a href="judges.html">Judges</a> <strong>WILL</strong> use <code>chkentry(1)</code> on this file during the
judging process and if it does not pass your submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected.</p>
<p>An obvious example where <code>chkentry</code> would fail to validate <code>.info.json</code> is if
there is a mismatch of type in the JSON file with what is expected, for
instance, if in <code>.info.json</code> the <code>no_comment</code> that we chose to not comment on is
not a string. Another obvious example is when things are out of range (see above
for list). Two more examples would be if a field is missing or if an unknown
filed is in the file. In these cases (and any others that must be established as
valid by <code>chkentry</code>) your submission would be rejected for violating <a href="next/rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a> and in particular because <code>chkentry</code> would not
validate the <code>.info.json</code> file.</p>
<p>If you wish to <strong>verify</strong> that your <code>.info.json</code> file is valid <strong>JSON</strong> then see the
FAQ on “<a href="#validating_json">validating JSON documents</a>”.</p>

<div id="author_handle_faq">
<h3 id="q-3.6-what-is-an-author_handle">Q 3.6: What is an <code>author_handle</code>?</h3>
</div>
<p>An <code>author_handle</code> is string that refers to a given author and is unique to the
IOCCC. Each author has exactly one <code>author_handle</code>.</p>
<p>For each <code>author_handle</code>, there will be a JSON file of the form:
<code>author/author_handle.json</code>.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_author">fixing author information</a>”
for information about how to update
and/or correct IOCCC author information.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#auth_json">.auth.json</a>”
for information about the contents of these JSON files and
how they are used.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#find_author_handle">finding author handle</a>”
for how to find your own <em>author_handle</em>.</p>
<p>Because the <code>author_handle</code> is used to form a JSON filename, the string must be
POSIX safe string plus the use of <code>+</code> (for technical reasons beyond this
answer). In particular, the <code>author_handle</code> must be an ASCII string or
32 characters or less that matches this regexp:</p>
<pre><code>    ^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z._+-]*$&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Default <code>author_handle</code>’s do not have multiple consecutive <code>_</code> (underscore)
characters. Nevertheless, multiple consecutive <code>_</code> (underscore) characters are
allowed. Contest submitters who wish to override their default <code>author_handle</code>
may do so, long as the ASCII string matches the regexp above AND
so long as the length does not exceed the 32 ASCII characters (not including
the terminating NUL byte).</p>
<p>The <code>author_handle</code> is derived from the name of the author. While there is a
algorithm that maps the name of the author (which can contain any UTF-8
characters) into a default <code>author_handle</code> string, those who submit an entry to
the IOCCC are free to choose a different <code>author_handle</code> string if they so
desire.</p>
<p>An <code>author</code> who has won a previous IOCCC is encouraged to reuse their
<code>author_handle</code> so that new winning entries can be associated with the same
author.</p>
<p>For an anonymous <code>author</code>, their handle is one of the form of <code>Anonymous_year</code>
or <code>Anonymous_year.digits</code>.</p>
<p>The latter form is in case there are more than one anonymous author in a given
year.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: even if the directory name is not <code>anonymous</code> the above rules apply as in
in the case of <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2005/anon/anon.c">2005/anon</a>.</p>
<p>Anonymous <code>author_handle</code>’s match this regexp:</p>
<pre><code>    Anonymous_[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][.0-9]*$</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: The contents of these JSON files contain the best known
information about authors of IOCCC entries and is used to help form
HTML files as well to contact an author.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: tools to validate the <code>author_handle.json</code> files, which are only for
winning authors, are in the works (which will be documented after they are
developed). See the
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handles</a>”
for more information on author handles.</p>
<p>The content of these JSON files are used by tools from the <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory</a>
to help build HTML content for the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC website</a>.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>index.html</code> file for each IOCCC entry contains selected
information about the authors. Tools from the <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory</a>
use the content of these JSON files to generate the <code>index.html</code> files for each
IOCCC winning entry.</p>
<p>Moreover, should the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> need to
contact an authors of an IOCCC entry, they will consult the contents
of the author’s JSON file for ways to contact them.</p>
<p>Each author of an IOCCC winning entry has their own <code>author_handle.json</code> file
of the form <code>author/author_handle.json</code>.</p>
<p>where <em>author_handle</em> is an author handle. See
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handle</a>”
for more information about an author handles.</p>
<h4 id="author_handle.json-json-file-contents"><code>author_handle.json</code> JSON file contents</h4>
<p>The syntax of a <code>author_handle.json</code> follows the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>.
See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" class="uri">https://www.json.org/json-en.html</a> for information on the <em>So-called JSON
spec</em>.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the JSON file contents of a <code>author_handle.json</code> file
is to look at an example, for instance the <code>author_handle.json</code> file for Yusuke
Endoh, <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/author/Yusuke_Endoh.json">author/Yusuke_Endoh.json</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: if you need to just check the validity of a JSON document then see the
FAQ on “<a href="#validating_json">validating JSON documents</a>”. Taking that FAQ in mind,
if you wish to validate every JSON file in <code>author/</code> then you could do so like:</p>
<pre class="&lt;!--sh--&gt;"><code>    for auth in *.json; do jparse -q &quot;$auth&quot; || echo &quot;$auth is invalid JSON&quot; ; done</code></pre>
<p>If you see any output then it will say which file or files are invalid JSON
(this should not actually happen, however).</p>

<em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> the version of the contents! When updating an

As of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em>, the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be <em>“1.0 2023-06-10”</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>author_JSON_format_version</em> would only changed when the overall format
of the these files is modified: and then only those who maintain the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC website</a> would be the one to do this
in conjunction with changes to <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tools</a>.</p>
<h5 id="author_handle">author_handle</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;author_handle&quot; : &quot;Yusuke_Endoh&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the author handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>author_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em>
and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em> that is also a value author handle.</p>
<p>See
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handle</a>”
for more information about an author handles.</p>
<p>Normally the <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> should <strong>NOT</strong> be changed
<strong>unless there is a strong reason to do so</strong>. If the <em>JSON value</em>
changes, then all of the <code>.entry.json</code> files for all of this authors
winning IOCCC entries should also be changed. The <em>author_handle</em>
<em>JSON value</em> must match the basename (without the leading path and
without the trailing <code>.json</code>) of the <code>author_handle.json</code> file. So
a change of <em>author_handle</em> <em>JSON value</em> would also require the
<code>author_handle.json</code> file to also be renamed.</p>
<h5 id="full_name">full_name</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;full_name&quot; : &quot;Yusuke Endoh&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the full name of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>full_name</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The full name of an author may use non-ASCII characters so long as the
full name is properly encoded as a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<h5 id="sort_word">sort_word</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;sort_word&quot; : &quot;endoh&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the string that will be used to sort the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>. Moreover the string <strong>MUST</strong> be a lower case ASCII
alphanumeric string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter.</p>
<p>The <em>JSON value</em> is used, for example, to place a reference to the author
in the <code>/authors.html</code> file.</p>
<p>Normally the <code>sort_word</code> <em>JSON member</em> <em>JSON value</em> is the last
name of the author, translated into lower case ASCII alphanumeric
string that starts with a lower case ASCII letter. If the author
wishes to be found in the <code>/authors.html</code> file under a different
string, such as if they wish to be listed under their first name
or their username, then they may change this accordingly.</p>
<h5 id="location_code">location_code</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;location_code&quot; : &quot;JP&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the string that is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code</a>
of the author’s location or country.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>location_code</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em>. Moreover the string <strong>MUST</strong> be 2 character UPPER case ASCII
alphabetic string that is <strong>NOT</strong> an Unassigned
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table">ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code</a> value
(not a 2 character symbol with a gray background on that Wikipedia table)</p>
<p>The <code>soup/location</code> tool from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>,
when run without arguments, will print the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes that permitted, along with
the location name.</p>
<p>We use the term “location” (and not “country”) because some of the
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes belong to locations that are not technically
a country, such as “Antarctica” or a User-assigned code.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify a location, they should select <strong>XX</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="email">email</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;email&quot; : &quot;mame@ruby-lang.org&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the email address of the author, or is the value null.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>email</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an email address, or if the email address is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;email&quot; : null</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="url">url</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : &quot;https://mametter.hatenablog.com&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the URL of the author’s home page.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify a URL or if the URL is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON
member</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : null</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="alt_url">alt_url</h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;alt_url&quot; : null</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds an alternate or 2nd URL a home page for the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>alt_url</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>In some cases the author may wish to record a special URL for their IOCCC entry,
or a 2nd URL such as a work or school or personal home page. For example,
Cody as of <em>Thu Nov 30 23:51:12 UTC 2023</em> used:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;alt_url&quot; : &quot;https://ioccc.xexyl.net&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an alternate URL, or if the alternate URL is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON
member</em>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;alt_url&quot; : null</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="deprecated_twitter_handle">deprecated_twitter_handle</h5>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> used to hold the twitter handle of the author.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.</p>
<p>The IOCCC no longer is associated with twitter (or whatever someone chooses to call it),
and so the <code>deprecated_twitter_handle</code> is <strong>no longer used</strong>. A <em>JSON value</em> that is
not a <em>JSON null</em> is kept for only historic reasons. For example, Anthony C. Howe
once used:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;deprecated_twitter_handle&quot; : &quot;@SirWumpus&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify a twitter handle, or if the twitter handle is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;deprecated_twitter_handle&quot; : null</code></pre>
<p>Of course in the future we will not be asking for twitter handles so this means
that unless the winner is a previous winner (before we moved to mastodon) this
will always be <code>null</code> anyway.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The <em>JSON null</em> is <strong>NOT</strong> enclosed in quotes!</p>
<h5 id="mastodon">mastodon</h5>

<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>mastodon</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em> just be a valid
Mastodon handle. In particular is must start with an at sign (<em><span class="citation" data-cites="_">@_</span>), followed by the
Mastodon username, followed by a 2nd sign (</em>@_), followed by the Mastodon server instance
used by the author.</p>
<p>For more information in Mastodon, see the <a href="https://mastodon.help">Mastodon help</a> guide.
See the “Mastodon Address” section of that page in particular.</p>
<p>The IOCCC Mastodon handle is:</p>
<pre><code>    @ioccc@fosstodon.org</code></pre>
<p>The IOCCC uses the Mastodon social network for announcements such
as the opening and closing of a new IOCCC, changes to the IOCCC web
site, updates during the judging process, and when new IOCCC entries
are selected. We recommend you follow us on Mastodon.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon handle, or if the Mastodon handle is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>

be a <em>JSON string</em> or it <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>. The <em>JSON string</em> just be a valid URL.
If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON null</em>, them the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON null</em>.
If the <code>mastodon</code> handle is a <em>JSON string</em>, then the <code>mastodon_url</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>The <code>mastodon_url</code> is just a translation of the above mentioned Mastodon handle.
For example, if the Mastodon handle is <code>@user@server.domain</code>, then the
<code>mastodon_url</code> would be <code>https://server.domain/@user</code>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an Mastodon URL, or if the Mastodon URL is
unknown, it should be the <em>JSON null</em> as the <em>JSON value</em> of this <em>JSON member</em>.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;mastodon_url&quot; : null</code></pre>

<p>The IOCCC uses GitHub to hold the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">official winner repo of the IOCCC</a>,
and hosts <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC website</a> on GitHub pages.</p>
<p>The IOCCC GitHub handle is <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/"><span class="citation" data-cites="ioccc-src">@ioccc-src</span></a>.</p>
<p>If the author wishes to not specify an GitHub handle, or if the GitHub handle is

<h3 id="q-3.8-how-can-i-find-my-author-handle">Q 3.8: How can I find my author handle?</h3>
</div>
<p>If you are an <em>author</em> of a winning <em>entry</em>, you may find your own <em>author_handle</em>
by going to your entry in the <a href="authors.html">authors.html</a> web page and viewing the string
that follows the <em>author_handle</em>: line.</p>
<p>If you are not someone who has won a previous IOCCC, you will be able to select
a potential <em>author_handle</em> when you form your <em>submission</em> tarball (see
FAQ on “<a href="#submit">how to submit</a>”
).</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Hint</strong>: If an <em>author</em> clicks on their <em>author_handle:</em>
line link, you will be taken to that author’s <code>author_handle.json</code> file.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="authors.html#Brian_Westley">Brian Westley</a> can view his
author entry and see that his <em>author_handle</em> is <strong>Brian_Westley</strong>.
Clicking on the <em>author_handle</em> shows the contents of
the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/author/Brian_Westley.json">Brian_Westley.json</a> file.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: An <code>author</code> who has won a previous IOCCC is encouraged to reuse their
<code>author_handle</code> so that new winning entries can be associated with the same author.</p>

<p>An <code>entry_id</code> is a string that identifies a winning entry of the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An <code>entry_id</code> is a 4-digit year, followed by an underscore, followed by a directory name.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>entry_id</code> associated with Cody Boone Ferguson’s 2nd winning IOCCC entry
of 2020 is found under the directory
<a href="2020/ferguson2/index.html">2020/ferguson2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: The contents of this JSON file contain information about each winning
entry in JSON format.</p>
<p>Each winning entry has a <code>.entry.json</code> file that includes data in JSON format
about the entry. We describe the fields below in order to help you understand
its contents.</p>
<p>This file is created by the <a href="bin/index.html#cvt-submission">cvt-submission.sh</a>
tool as part of the final steps to announce a new set of winning IOCCC entries.</p>
<p>Each winning entry has its own <code>.entry.json</code> filename of the form:
<code>YYYY/winner/.entry.json</code></p>
<p>.. where <em>winner</em> is the entry directory name, usually the name of the author.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: this file should <strong>NOT</strong> be manually modified! It is created
by the <a href="bin/index.html#csv2entry">csv2entry</a> tool when updating the manifest.</p>
<h4 id="entry.json-json-file-contents"><code>.entry.json</code> JSON file contents</h4>
<p>The syntax of a <code>.entry.json</code> follows the <em>So-called JSON spec</em>.
See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" class="uri">https://www.json.org/json-en.html</a> for information on the <em>So-called JSON
spec</em>.</p>
<p>A good way to understand the JSON file contents of a <code>.entry.json</code> file
is to look at an example, for instance the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/laman/.entry.json">1984/laman/.entry.json</a> file, as
it is shorter than some of the others.</p>

<div id="walk_through_entry_json">
<h5 id="walk-through-of-a-.entry.json-file">Walk through of a <code>.entry.json</code> file</h5>
</div>
<p>We now will walk through the above JSON document looking at all the JSON
members:</p>
<h5 id="no_comment-1"><code>no_comment</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;no_comment&quot; : &quot;mandatory comment: because comments were removed from the original JSON spec&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Because the authors of the so-called JSON spec removed the ability to use comments in JSON
(for reason(s) that seem to be less than credible), the IOCCC mandates this <em>JSON member</em>
be present in all IOCCC related JSON files.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>no_comment</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong>
be the exact <em>JSON string</em> as shown above.</p>
<h5 id="entry_json_format_version"><code>entry_JSON_format_version</code></h5>
<pre><code>        &quot;entry_JSON_format_version&quot; : &quot;1.2 2024-09-25&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This <em>JSON member</em> holds the format version of the <code>.entry.json</code> JSON file.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>entry_JSON_format_version</code>
<em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em> <strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> the version of the contents!</p>
<p>The <code>entry_JSON_format_version</code> would only changed when the overall format
of the these files is modified: and then only those who maintain the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org">official IOCCC website</a> would be the one to do this
in conjunction with changes to <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tools</a>.</p>
<h5 id="award"><code>award</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;award&quot; : &quot;Third Place&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This JSON string is the award title of the entry which the <a href="judges.html">Judges</a>
decide/decided when it becomes/became a winning entry.</p>
<h5 id="year"><code>year</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;year&quot; : 1984</code></pre>
<p>This JSON number is the year the contest ran, ended or was announced in.</p>
<h5 id="dir"><code>dir</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;dir&quot; : &quot;laman&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This JSON string is the subdirectory of the entry, <strong>under</strong> the year directory,
in this case <a href="1984/index.html">1984</a>. With the above member, <code>year</code>, and this
one, one can determine the directory of the entry, here being
<a href="1984/laman/index.html">1984/laman</a>.</p>
<h5 id="entry_id-1"><code>entry_id</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;entry_id&quot; : &quot;1984_laman&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This is the ID of the entry in question and corresponds to the <code>entry_id</code> in the
<code>author/author_handle.json</code> file.</p>
<p>See
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handle</a>”
for more information about author handles.</p>
<p>See
FAQ on “<a href="#author_json">author_handle.json</a>”
for information about the contents of these JSON file and
how they are used.</p>
<h5 id="title"><code>title</code></h5>
<p>The <code>title</code> for an entry’s <code>.entry.json</code> file defaults to
“<code>YYYY/dirname</code>”. The <code>title</code> is not used at this time.</p>
<p>For IOCCC winning entries after 2020, the <code>title</code> is obtained from the
<code>.info.json</code> file with the entry was a submission.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#info_json">.info.json</a>”
for more information on <code>.info.json</code> files.</p>
<h5 id="abstract"><code>abstract</code></h5>
<p>The <code>abstract</code> is a summary of the entry. The <code>abstract</code> is used as a
head line in an entry’s <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>For IOCCC winning entries after 2020, the <code>abstract</code> is obtained from the
<code>.info.json</code> file with the entry was a submission.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#info_json">.info.json</a>”
for more information on <code>.info.json</code> files.</p>
<h5 id="author_set"><code>author_set</code></h5>
<pre><code>    &quot;author_set&quot; : [
        { &quot;author_handle&quot; : &quot;Mike_Laman&quot; }
    ]</code></pre>
<p>This JSON <strong>array</strong> has a list of <code>author_handle</code>s that indicate who won this
entry.</p>
<p>That <em>JSON member</em> holds the author handle of the author.</p>
<p>In most cases there is only one <code>author_handle</code> in a <code>.entry.json</code> file but in
some there is more than one.</p>
<p>See
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handle</a>”
for more information about an author handles.</p>
<p>Normally the <code>author_handle</code> <em>JSON value</em> should <strong>NOT</strong> be changed
<strong>unless there is a strong reason to do so</strong>. If the <em>JSON value</em>
changes, then all of the <code>.entry.json</code> files for all of this author’s
winning IOCCC entries should also be changed. The <code>author_handle</code>
<em>JSON value</em> must match the basename (without the leading path and
without the trailing <code>.json</code>) of the <code>author_handle.json</code> file. So
a change of <code>author_handle</code> <em>JSON value</em> would also require the
<code>author_handle.json</code> file to also be renamed.</p>
<p>The full name of an author may use non-ASCII characters so long as the
full name is properly encoded as a <em>JSON string</em>.</p>
<h5 id="manifest"><code>manifest</code></h5>
<p>Finally there is the manifest JSON <strong>array</strong> that lists the files of the winning
entry. Because each array member (a file) has the same fields we will only list
one of the files in the manifest, providing comments about each field. After
that we will list some files that are mandatory files, also with comments.</p>
<p>There <strong>MUST</strong> be one and only one <code>manifest</code> <em>JSON member</em> and the <em>JSON value</em>
<strong>MUST</strong> be a <em>JSON</em> array.</p>
<p>A shortened manifest for our example entry is:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;manifest&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;file_path&quot; : &quot;laman.c&quot;,
            &quot;inventory_order&quot; : 20,
            &quot;OK_to_edit&quot; : true,
            &quot;display_as&quot; : &quot;c&quot;,
            &quot;display_via_github&quot; : true,
            &quot;entry_text&quot; : &quot;entry source code&quot;
        }
    ]</code></pre>
<p>Now we will describe each field of each file in the manifest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>file_path</code> (string)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>string</strong> is the name of the file in question.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>inventory_order</code> (number)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>number</strong> decides which file list in the <code>index.html</code> file this
file is listed and its order in that list. The details are beyond the scope
of this document and it is only necessary to understand this if you are
adding a file to the manifest. However as the <a href="judges.html">Judges</a> are the
ones who will be doing this this need not concern you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>OK_to_edit</code> (boolean)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>boolean</strong> indicates whether this file should be modified,
edited, replaced, or even removed directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>true</code> then a modification (i.e., edit) of the file, replacement of the file,
or even removal os the file would be welcome via a pull request.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>If <code>false</code>, then the file almost certainlty should <strong>NOT</strong> be modified
(i.e., edited), replaced or removed. Submitting a pull request that impacts
such a <code>false</code> <code>OK_to_edit</code> file is likely to cause the pull request
to be modifed or rejected.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: In most all cases, <code>OK_to_edit</code> should be set to <code>true</code>.
There are only a few cases when <code>OK_to_edit</code> needs to be <code>false</code> that are documented below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason for <code>OK_to_edit == false</code> # 0</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The file is original source code file.</p>
<p>Modifications of the <strong>original source code</strong> is only permitted it can
be shown at the file is not the true <strong>original source code</strong>.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#orig_c">original source code</a>”
for more information including how to open an <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues">IOCCC issue</a>
if you believe the <strong>original source code</strong> is not a true original.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason for <code>OK_to_edit == false</code> # 1</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The HTML file is generated by a <a href="bin/index.html">set of tools and scripts</a>(including a related <code>Makefile</code> rule).</p>
<p>Modifing HTML files that contain comments such as “<em>DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE …</em>”
or “<em>Do not modify this web page …</em>” will not have the desired effect
because any modications will be overridden when the <a href="bin/index.html">set of tools and scripts</a>
(includeing a related <code>Makefile</code> rule).</p>
<p>In order to properly change a generated HTML file, files such as a markdown file
(often <code>README.md</code>) and/or sometimes JSON files (such as <code>.entry.json</code> or
the <code>author/author_handle.json</code> JSON files)</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_website">fix web site</a>”
for information on submitting fixes to the IOCCC website.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_author">update IOCCC author information</a>”
for information how to modify <code>author/author_handle.json</code> JSON files.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason for <code>OK_to_edit == false</code> # 2</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The file is a compressed tarball for an entry or set of entries for a given IOCCC year.</p>
<p>Compressed tarball files are provided as a conveience for those who wish th download
an IOCCC entry or all IOCCC entries for a given IOCCC year. These files are generate
by <a href="bin/index.html">set of tools and scripts</a>(including a related <code>Makefile</code> rules).</p>
<p>Instead of trying to modify a compressed tarball, individual files that make
up the compressed tarball should be modified instead. When you pull request to modify
such individual files, the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> will run the appropriate
<a href="bin/index.html">set of tools and scripts</a> to update the compressed tarballs as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason for <code>OK_to_edit == false</code> # 3</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>The file is a <code>.path</code> file.</p>
<p>As the <code>.path</code> file is related to the path of the entry under an IOCCC year,
this file should be consider as <strong>read-only</strong>.</p>
<p>If you believe a <code>.path</code> file is in error, then please open up an
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues">IOCCC issue</a>.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#dot_path">.path files</a>”
for more information on <code>.path</code> files.</p>
<p>See also the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_an_entry">fixing an entry</a>”
for information on opening up an IOCCC issue.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reason for <code>OK_to_edit == false</code> # 4</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p>There is some rare case or reason we forgot to document.</p>
<p>The reasons previously listed for why the <code>OK_to_edit</code> set to <code>false</code> may be incomplete,
or there is some special rare case. More likely, however, if some other file has
<code>OK_to_edit</code> set to <code>false</code>, is a mistake.</p>
<p>If you believe if <code>OK_to_edit</code> has the wrong value, please open a GitHub pull request.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information about pull requests.</p></li>
<li><p><code>display_as</code> (string)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>string</strong> describes what kind of file it is and in particular
how to <strong>display</strong> it. An entry source code file would be (all strings are
lower case) <code>c</code>, a shell script would be <code>shellscript</code> and a <code>Makefile</code>
would be <code>makefile</code>, for three examples of others. As updating the manifest
is mostly a task for the <a href="judges.html">Judges</a> you need not concern yourself
with all the different names.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>display_via_github</code> (boolean)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>boolean</strong> indicates whether the file should be viewed at
(that is linked to) GitHub or not. A good reason it might be viewed at
GitHub is for syntax highlighting or if it should not be downloaded but
would likely be downloaded by the browser otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>entry_text</code> (string)</p>
<ul>
<li>This <em>JSON</em> <strong>string</strong> is a short string that gives a summary of what the
file is, for purposes of the file lists in the <code>index.html</code> inventory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have discussed the <em>JSON members</em> of each file in the <code>manifest</code> we
will give a list of <strong>MANDATORY</strong> files (for winning entry source code the names
will depend on the year).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the entry source code</p>
<ul>
<li>This file is typically called <code>winner.c</code>, where <code>winner</code> is as described
above, or <code>prog.c</code> (for later years). The <code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"entry   source code"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the entry Makefile</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the submission’s Makefile <strong>modified</strong> by the <a href="judges.html">Judges</a>,
should the submission win. The <code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"entry Makefile"</code> and
the <code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> <code>"Makefile"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>the original source code file</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the entry source code file that was submitted and that won. This
will be named either <code>winner.orig.c</code> or <code>prog.orig.c</code>, depending on the
year. This file may <strong>NOT</strong> be modified. The <code>entry_text</code> for this file is
always <code>"original source code"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#original_source_code">original source code</a>”
for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>the <a href="#tarball">entry tarball</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the tarball of just the top level Makefile (and those included by
it) and the entry itself, for convenience. It is named in the form of
<code>YYYY_winner.tar.bz2</code>. For instance, for <a href="1984/laman/index.html">1984/laman</a>
it is called <code>1984_laman.tar.bz2</code>. This file is <strong>NOT</strong> displayed via
GitHub. The <code>entry_text</code> is always <code>download entry tarball</code> as it is a file
that is to be downloaded, should one wish to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="#entry_json">.entry.json</a> file</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the file we’re currently discussing, the <code>.entry.json</code> file. The
<code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"entry summary and manifest in JSON"</code> and the
<code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> <code>".entry.json"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>.gitignore</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The list of files that should not be committed under git. Its <code>entry_text</code>
is always <code>"list of files that should not be committed under git"</code> and the
<code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> <code>".gitignore"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>.path</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This file contains the path to the entry subdirectory from the top level
directory. For instance for <a href="1984/laman/index.html">1984/laman</a> it is
<code>"1984/laman"</code>. This file’s <code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"directory path from top   level directory"</code> and the <code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> <code>".path"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>README.md</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This file is the markdown source file for the <code>index.html</code> file. Its
<code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"markdown source for this web page"</code> (because it is
listed in <code>index.html</code>) and the <code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> <code>"README.md"</code>
(renamed from the <code>remarks.md</code> provided in submissions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, if the entry has other html files then they are also formed
from markdown files and the <code>entry_text</code> will be similar; the <code>file_path</code> in
these cases will be the same as the html file except it will have the
extension <code>.md</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>index.html</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This is the main page of the entry, formed from the <code>README.md</code> file. Its
<code>entry_text</code> is always <code>"this web page"</code> and its <code>file_path</code> is <strong>ALWAYS</strong>
<code>"index.html"</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the entry has an alternate source code file, often it will be in the form of
<code>"winner.alt.c"</code> or <code>"prog.alt.c"</code>; this is also what the <code>file_path</code> will be.
The <code>entry_text</code> will typically (not always but almost always) be <code>"alternate source code"</code>.</p>
<p>Many entries have a script (or scripts) for the <code>Try</code> section in their index.html file.
Usually this is called <code>try.sh</code> for the winning entry and <code>try.alt.sh</code> for the alternate
source code (if there is an alternate version). Some, however, have another file
name. The <code>entry_text</code> for the <code>try</code> scripts will be <code>script to try entry</code> or
something along those lines.</p>

<div id="jparse">
<h3 id="q-3.11-how-can-i-validate-any-json-document">Q 3.11: How can I validate any JSON document?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you want or need to verify that a JSON document (as a string or file) is
valid, you can use the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/jparse/README.md">jparse</a>
tool. The IOCCC version of the <code>jparse(1)</code> tool may be installed from the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/FAQ.md#download">FAQ.md file in the mkiocccentry
repo</a>
contains information about how to find and compile the mkiocccentry
toolkit, which includes the IOCCC version of the <code>jparse(1)</code> tool, located
under the <code>mkiocccentry</code> directory as <code>jparse/jparse</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally you may install the <code>jparse(1)</code> tool from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry
repo</a>:</p>
<pre class="&lt;!--sh--&gt;"><code>    git clone https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry.git
    cd mkiocccentry &amp;&amp; make clobber all&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2
    cd jparse &amp;&amp; sudo make install clobber&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of <code>jparse(1)</code> is very simple:</p>
<pre class="&lt;!--sh--&gt;"><code>    jparse foo.json</code></pre>
<p>If the tool exits 0 then the document is valid JSON; otherwise it’ll
show an error message.</p>
<p>If you want to see more information about the parsing you can increase the
verbosity with the <code>-v</code> option. For instance:</p>
<pre class="&lt;!--sh--&gt;"><code>    jparse -v 3 foo.json</code></pre>
<p>If the tool is not installed then you will obviously have to specify the path of
the tool.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the <code>jparse</code> subdirectory is a clone of the official <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues">jparse
repo</a> but we recommend you compile and
install via the <code>mkiocccentry</code> repo because it has the dependencies built in,
and because the <code>mkiocccentry</code> copy is that which is used by the current IOCCC,
as the two can be different at times.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In general the best way to compile everything in an entry directory is to run:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber all</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to compile every entry for every year you should go to the top level
directory and run the same command as above, <code>make clobber all</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>all</code> rule will build everything necessary except for the alternate
versions. Every Makefile has an <code>alt</code> rule but it will only do something if an
alternate version exists. To build all the entries along with any alternate code
you can do from the top level directory:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber everything</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to only build alternate code you can do:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber alt</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to not remove the entry binaries and only compile the additional alt
versions:</p>
<pre><code>    make alt</code></pre>
<p>The following Makefile rules should be in all Makefiles:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>all</code>: build the entry programs (main program and any supplementary program)</li>
<li><code>alt</code>: build alternate code</li>
<li><code>clobber</code>: clean up object files and all binary files (except for those that are
not compiled)</li>
<li><code>clean</code>: a simpler version of <code>clobber</code> that only removes object files. <code>make clobber</code> depends on <code>clean</code> so running <code>make clobber</code> will invoke <code>make clean</code>.</li>
<li><code>everything</code>: equivalent to <code>make all alt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any other rules? You tell us!</p>
<p>The top level and the year (e.g. <code>1984/Makefile</code>, <code>1985/Makefile</code> etc.)
<code>Makefile</code>s recurse into the subdirectories for each entry so you can compile
individual entries, entries of a given year or all entries, based on what you
wish to do.</p>
<p>NOTE about the above rules: the Makefile default assumes <code>cc</code> which might be a
gcc-based compiler, or a clang-based compiler, or some other compiler. Only by
forcing <code>CC=clang</code> or <code>CC=gcc</code> will one invoke a specific compiler to, say,
enable or disable additional warnings or flags. Even so different versions or
compilers might do different things, have different defects or other issues.
Note that the <code>Makefile</code>s check the <code>CC</code> variable by substrings so that if you
were to do something like <code>make CC=gcc=mp-12</code> it would register as <code>gcc</code>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC</a> <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry submission
toolkit</a> and the <a href="years.html">winning IOCCC
entries</a> we support <em>ONLY</em> GNU Makefile syntax. This means that if
you only have Cygwin or a BSD <code>make(1)</code> (often <code>bmake(1)</code>) or some other
<code>make(1)</code> utility the Makefiles we use will not be compatible.</p>
<p>We do not intend on supporting anything but the GNU <code>make(1)</code> utility so if you
do not currently have it installed you will have to do that in order to compile
entries for the IOCCC. If you are submitting an entry this will also be
necessary.</p>
<p>If you do not have GNU <code>make(1)</code> you might look for <code>gmake</code> as that is what it
often is packaged as. Then you can use <code>gmake</code> instead. For instance if you go
to the top level directory of the winner repo you can do:</p>
<pre><code>    gmake</code></pre>
<p>In the case that the Makefile uses the <code>MAKE</code> variable you will have to override
it like:</p>
<pre><code>    gmake MAKE=gmake</code></pre>
<p>though of course for both you may specify a rule or rules to run.</p>

</div>
<p>You must have the X11 related include files and X11 libraries in order to
compile the IOCCC entry. In order to do this you will need to install Xorg and
related packages including development related packages. If you have macOS see
further down for different instructions. Otherwise: in particular you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the Xorg server.</li>
<li>Configure the Xorg server for your graphics environment.</li>
<li>Install a X11 terminal application.</li>
<li>Start the Xorg server.</li>
<li>Launch the X11 terminal application.</li>
<li>Run the IOCCC entry in the X11 terminal application.</li>
</ul>
<p>By X11 terminal application we suggest one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a> terminal application</li>
<li><a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> terminal application</li>

<h4 id="x.org-server-has-been-deprecated">X.org server has been deprecated</h4>
</div>
<p>The Red Hat RHEL9.0 release notes state that <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_graphics-infrastructures">X.org Server is now
deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/install-xorg-on-linux">Linux for Devices tutorial on
XOrg</a> as
of 2023 Mar 25:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, RHEL developers categorized <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality">Xorg was put in the ‘deprecated’
software</a>,
as its development has mostly halted. Subsequent updates will completely replace
it with Wayland, a more modern windowing system.. Although Wayland is not fully
developed yet, many applications do not support it properly yet and screen
sharing might not work sometime, but it is the future. Fedora, also developed by
RHEL, has switched to a Wayland session as it’s default windowing system (And it
works flawlessly on my Laptop).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org">Wayland</a> website for more details.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: We do <strong>NOT</strong> know if IOCCC entries will run under
<strong>Wayland</strong>. Some IOCCC entries that use X11 might be OK while other IOCCC
entries that use X11 in an unusual way might fail under <strong>Wayland</strong>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html">Wayland FAQ</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>If your system uses <strong>Wayland</strong> and not X11, you might give the IOCCC entries
that use X11 a try. They might work but again we do not know.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> <strong>do not support IOCCC entries</strong>.
See the
FAQ on “<a href="#no_support">no entry support</a>”.
So if an IOCCC entry that uses X11 fails under <strong>Wayland</strong>, and you wish to
provide a fix to the IOCCC entry so that it will run under <strong>Wayland</strong>,
then consider submitting a fix so that it will run under <strong>Wayland</strong>.
See the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_an_entry">fixing an entry</a>”
for more information.</p>
<p>Basically: if you discover an entry does not work in Wayland you are welcome to
provide <strong>alternate code</strong> that works for Wayland. We will happily credit you in
the <a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks-for-help.html</a> file.</p>
<h4 id="red-hat-based-linux">Red Hat based Linux</h4>
<p>First, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#X11_general">general X11</a>”.</p>
<p>Install Xorg and related packages:</p>
<pre><code>    sudo dnf install --skip-broken --best --exclude xorgxrdp \
    --exclude xorgxrdp-glamor &#39;*xorg*&#39; &#39;libx*&#39; &#39;libX*&#39; &#39;fontconfig*&#39;</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The X.org server has been deprecated.
See the

for more information.</p>
<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>
<p>First, see the
FAQ on “<a href="#X11_general">general X11</a>”.
However, for macOS, instead of installing the Xorg server, you need to install and launch
the <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent XQuartz</a> application
and then run the IOCCC entry from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window
shell</a>.</p>
<p>As an example we will use <a href="1993/jonth/index.html">1993/jonth</a> which works
with macOS 14.2.1 (macOS Sonoma).</p>
<p>First of all you will need to install the <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">most recent
XQuartz</a>, preferably on an <a href="https://support.apple.com/macOS">Apple supported version of
macOS, preferably the most recent version</a>.
After it is installed, open the “XQuartz” application (usually located in
<code>/Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</code>) by typing at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>    open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app</code></pre>
<p>With the “XQuartz” application open you will get an <a href="https://www.x.org/wiki/">X Window System
Manager</a> launched with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">Xterm window
shell</a> started:</p>
<p><img alt="xterm-launch in macOS" src="png/xquartz-shell.png"></p>
<p>At this point you need to cd to the winning directory and compile it. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="compiling an entry in xterm in macOS" src="png/xquartz-entry-compile.png"></p>
<p>And then run the program as directed by the <code>index.html</code> file. For example with
<code>1993/jonth</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="running 1993/jonth in macOS" src="png/xquartz-1993-jonth.png"></p>
<p>Note that you can compile the code in your regular terminal prior to opening
XQuartz, should you wish to. You can even run it from that terminal and it
should open XQuartz.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some entries that won the IOCCC, particularly entries from long ago, might not
compile on more modern systems because the C language has evolved (i.e. the
modern C compilers are much more strict in what they accept as a valid program),
or the entry depended on operation system and library features that where common
back then but are different/missing today.</p>
<p>In some cases the American National Standards Institute’s ANSI C committee has
damaged the C standard to the point where perfectly valid C programs no longer
compile with modern compilers. As such some old IOCCC entries can no longer be
compiled with modern compilers (though a great deal of these were fixed in
2023).</p>
<p>In other cases, it might be your compiler. For instance <code>clang</code> is very strict
on some things that <code>gcc</code> is perfectly fine with. A great deal of these have
been fixed but it is possible that some do not work.</p>
<p>In particular, some entries do require a certain compiler, or they might not
work with certain compilers or a certain architecture. Some entries generate C
code and some of that generated code will not compile with certain compilers,
usually <code>clang</code>.</p>
<p>Please see the other FAQs in this section as they might offer helpful
hints, especially in cases where something else needs to be installed.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for details about known problems with
IOCCC entries. In some cases you may be dealing with a problematic entry. In a
few fun cases, the IOCCC does not compile by design!</p>
<p>If you have a fix that makes a minimal impact to the entry, then
please consider submitting that change in the form of a pull request.
Please see
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_an_entry">fixing an entry</a>”.
See also the
FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>In some cases alternative code has been added that does compile on some or most
systems. Check the write up for the entry for “alt” code and possible ways to
compile and run that code. In some cases we replaced the original code (but not
the <code>.orig.c</code> file!) with code that works for modern systems but one can view
the original code in the <code>.orig.c</code> files (sometimes the original code is also in
the directory as a <code>dirname.alt.c</code> or <code>prog.alt.c</code>).</p>

<p>If the entry requires gcc and you did not explicitly install gcc in macOS you

<h3 id="q-6.2-why-do-makefiles-use--weverything-with-clang">Q 6.2: Why do Makefiles use -Weverything with clang?</h3>
</div>
<p>While we know that use of <code>-Weverything</code> is generally not recommended
by <code>clang</code> C compiler developers, we do use the <code>-Weverything</code>
option in a certain case in IOCCC entry <code>Makefile</code>s.</p>
<p>The use of <code>-Weverything</code> is limited to when one forces <code>CC=clang</code> or more
generally if the string ‘clang’ is in <code>$(CC)</code>. If <code>$(CC)</code> contains ‘gcc’ the
‘gcc’ specific options are run instead.</p>
<p>Users with clang compilers are not required to set <code>CC=clang</code> or equivalent but
when they do, <code>-Weverything</code> is enabled with all of its challenges, pedantic
warnings, and sometimes warnings about things that do not matter, some of which
are frankly frivolous and often downright dubious.</p>
<p>To enable this feature:</p>
<pre><code>    make clobber all CC=clang</code></pre>
<p>IOCCC authors who have access to <code>clang</code> might wish to try their
hand at compiling with <code>-Weverything</code> while using a minimum of <code>-Wno-foo</code>
statements. Sometimes there is a technical or pedantic issue that
<code>-Weverything</code> warns about that would merit a change to your C code; often,
however, it is not even possible to fix let alone is it worth it. Of course
if you’re running out of bytes due to rule 2[ab] one might not have much choice.
This is something that obfuscation authors simply sometimes have to deal with!</p>
<p>If you try to minimize the number of <code>-Wno-foo</code> options needed with
<code>-Weverything</code>, please mention this in your remarks about the entry, as the
judges note you attempt to honor it (see also below). In some cases your
obfuscated code will issue warnings with <code>-Weverything</code> no matter what: the
<code>-Wno-poison-system-directories</code> is a common example of this but there are
others as well, sometimes depending on the version of <code>clang</code>.</p>
<p>If you do try for a compile with <code>clang -Weverything</code>, keep on mind that while <em>your</em>
compile environment might be warning free, a different clang version or a
different build environment might still have warnings. For instance the warning
set is different in macOS (which by default is <code>clang</code>: even when run as <code>gcc</code>!)
than Linux (due to versions and possibly other things)!</p>
<p>Given that your entry <strong>MUST</strong> work as documented, you may be safer to
say that your entry keeps the number of warnings and <code>-Wno-foo</code> options while
compiling with <code>clang -Weverything</code> at a minimum. You might want to say the
version number and platform (OS and OS version) too as an extra safety net. Because if you claim zero
warnings, and we find a warning situation, this may diminish the value of your
entry as it is not as documented. Thus it might be wise to point this out and
if you can test it in multiple platforms (or versions of <code>clang</code>, see
below note) this would be advisable.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: different versions of <code>clang</code> have other differences as well. For instance
a defect of <code>clang</code> that required numerous entries to be fixed for clang is that it
requires that <code>main()</code>’s arguments to be of a specific type. However some
versions of <code>clang</code> are more strict in the number of args allowed.

</div>
<p>A lot of the entries, old and otherwise, have complicated uses and/or have
numerous uses, and having a script that automates these for viewers improves the
usability of these entries so one can enjoy them better.</p>
<p>The <code>try.sh</code> script is for the original entry and the <code>try.alt.sh</code> script is for
alternate versions. These scripts are usually for the <code>Try:</code> and <code>Alternate try:</code> sections in the <code>index.html</code> files.</p>
<p>Some entries provide additional scripts that are meant to run the entry as well
but might not fit in the <code>try</code> model though some are used by a <code>try.sh</code> /
<code>try.alt.sh</code> script.</p>
<p>Although you’re certainly welcome to copy and paste or type the commands in
manually, sometimes the scripts will do additional things that you might miss
and there are some other benefits as well which you would miss if you did not
use them. Nevertheless, if you prefer to do it manually, whether to help you

<p>What may have worked years ago may not work well or work at all today.
Please note that the IOCCC judges do <strong>NOT</strong> support IOCCC entries.
Nevertheless, there may be a number of reasons why an IOCCC entry
may fail to run well if it can run at all.</p>
<p>In some cases programs that may have worked on an old computer system
longer work on modern computers. Some IOCCC entries do not work well,
or no longer work on modern computers or modern operating systems, though again
a great deal of these were fixed for modern systems.</p>
<p>There are some cases where certain compilers or even certain versions are
necessary for the program to function in part or even completely.</p>
<p>Some IOCCC entries might operating system services that may not be present on
your system, as well.</p>
<p>In some cases the IOCCC entry simply has bugs or (Mis)features.</p>
<p>If you are having problems compiling or running an IOCCC entry,
we recommend that you look in <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> to see if
there is a known bugs or (Mis)feature. In some cases what you
may think is a bug is actually a feature that was intentionally
written by the author(s). In some cases the problem is well
known and we are looking for someone to attempt to fix it.</p>
<p>In some cases there is an alternate version of the IOCCC entry
that you may wish to try.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that you have discovered a bug in a winning IOCCC
entry. If so, you are invited to try and fix the IOCCC entry and
submit that fix by way of a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately some older entries are non-portable and require 32-bit support or
32-bit binaries. A problem system here is that as of macOS Catalina (10.15)
macOS no longer supports 32-bit binaries. If the entry acts on a certain
type of binary, say ELF, then that will also be a problem depending on the
entry. For example <a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a> requires 32-bit
ELF binaries.</p>
<p>There are a few example entries that require 32-bit binaries. We have tried
to note these in both the respective Makefiles and index.html files but it is
possible that some were missed. These entries are very likely in the
<a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file and we welcome any help in making an alternate version
for 64-bit systems. Many were fixed to work with modern systems but some are
supposed to only work with 32-bit systems so any updated version of these
entries should be an alternate version.</p>
<p>Other entries like <a href="thanks-for-help.html#2001_herrmann2">2001/herrmann2</a>
now work with 32-bit AND 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file for the problematic entry
in question to see if the problem is known, and if a fix is wanted,
consider trying to port the code to a 64-bit system and submitting
a pull request with that change. Pull requests that fix such code

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For some entries one needs to send interrupt or EOF or some other signal/other
special characters. There are typical defaults like (where <code>^</code> = ctrl):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^D</code> for EOF (<code>eof</code>)</li>
<li><code>^C</code> for interrupt (<code>intr</code>)</li>
<li><code>^U</code> for kill (<code>kill</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and various others. But if you don’t know this you can find out through the
<code>stty(1)</code> command with the <code>-a</code> option. For instance with macOS you might see:</p>
<pre><code>    $ stty -a
    speed 9600 baud; rows 40; columns 155;
    intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; [..snip..]</code></pre>
<p>If you know the name you can use <code>grep</code> to find the correct line and if your
implementation of <code>grep(1)</code> has the <code>-o</code> option you can filter it. For instance
to find what the <code>intr</code> is set to:</p>
<pre><code>    $ stty -a |grep -o &#39;intr = ^[[:alpha:]]&#39;
    intr = ^C</code></pre>
<p>… assuming of course that it’s a ctrl combination :-) If for some strange
reason it’s not you might have to do something else including just piping it to
just <code>grep intr</code> or whatever.</p>

<h4 id="individual-winning-entry-tarballs">Individual winning entry tarballs</h4>
<p>The individual entry tarballs are named in the form of
<code>YYYY/winner/YYYY_winner.tar.bz2</code> (e.g.
<a href="1984/mullender/1984_mullender.tar.bz2">1984/mullender/1984_mullender.tar.bz2</a>)
and they contain a single entry as well as some additional necessary files. Each
entry tarball is linked to in its <code>index.html</code> (e.g.
<a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender/index.html</a>) manifest, listed in the
<em>Secondary files</em> list.</p>
<p>These tarballs will have the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ioccc.css</code> - stylesheet for the html files</li>
<li><code>var.mk</code> - the top level Makefile included by all the other Makefiles that holds variables used by the Makefiles</li>
<li><code>YYYY/winner/.path</code> - directory path from top level directory</li>
<li><code>YYYY/winner/.entry.json</code> - entry summary and manifest in JSON</li>
<li><code>YYYY/winner/.gitignore</code> - list of files that should not be committed under git</li>
</ul>
<p>plus the winning entry files like source code, the Makefile, supplementary data
provided by the author and any other file in the winning entry, found under the
entry’s subdirectory.</p>
<p>If you downloaded <code>1984/mullender/1984_mullender.tar.bz2</code>, for instance, you might
then do:</p>
<pre><code>        cd 1984/mullender
        make everything
        ./mullender.alt</code></pre>
<p>to compile all versions and then run the alternate version (if you have
a PDP-11 or VAX-11 you would be able to run the original version). For more help
on compiling entries, see also the
FAQ on “<a href="#make_rules">IOCCC Makefile rules</a>”.</p>
<p>If you want to view the <code>index.html</code> file you can point your browser to the
<code>index.html</code> file of the winning entry (e.g. <code>1984/mullender/index.html</code>) with the
caveats noted above.</p>
<h4 id="year-based-tarballs">Year based tarballs</h4>
<p>The year based tarballs, which are under each year’s directory and are named in
the form of <code>YYYY/YYYY.tar.bz2</code> (e.g. <a href="1984/1984.tar.bz2">1984/1984.tar.bz2</a>),
include all the winning entries of a given year.
Each year’s tarball can be found under that year in the <a href="years.html">years.html</a>
page and in the year’s <code>index.html</code> as well (e.g.
<a href="1984/index.html">1984/index.html</a>).</p>
<p>These tarballs have, along with each entry’s directory and their respective
files (as if you downloaded each entry tarball of the year individually as
described above), the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.filelist</code> - list of files in the year that are not part of a winning entry of the year, including the <code>YYYY.tar.bz2</code> tarball</li>
<li><code>index.html</code> - the <code>YYYY/index.html</code> file rendered from the <code>YYYY/README.md</code> file</li>
<li><code>Makefile</code> - Makefile for the year to compile etc. all entries of the year</li>
<li><code>README.md</code> - the source of the <code>YYYY/index.html</code> file</li>
<li><code>rules.txt</code> - rules of the year’s contest</li>
<li><code>.year</code> - text file that has a list of the winning entries’ directories of the year</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, some will have extra files like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.gitignore</code> - list of files that should not be committed under git</li>
<li><code>guidelines.txt</code> - the guidelines of the year</li>
<li><code>iocccsize.c</code> - <code>iocccsize</code> tool of the year</li>
<li><code>iocccsize.mk</code> - Makefile to compile the <code>iocccsize</code> tool of the year</li>
<li><code>iocccsize-test.sh</code> - test suite for the <code>iocccsize</code> tool</li>
</ul>
<p>.. and perhaps some others we have neglected to mention as well.</p>
<p>If you extract a year’s tarball you can <code>cd YYYY</code> (e.g. <code>cd 1984</code>) and then run
<code>make everything</code> to compile the entries and alternate code of every entry, as
if you switched to each entry’s directory and ran <code>make everything</code> in each one.</p>
<p>If you download the 1984 tarball, i.e. <code>1984/1984.tar.bz2</code>, then you might
extract it and then switch to the directory and compile everything of each
entry:</p>
<pre><code>    cd 1984
    make everything</code></pre>
<p>For more help on compiling entries, see also the
FAQ on “<a href="#make_rules">IOCCC Makefile rules</a>”.</p>
<p>Of course in this case you can also switch to individual entries and look at the
<code>index.html</code> file (or any other file in the entry) and try out the entries that
interest you, as if you downloaded that entry’s individual tarball.</p>
<p>If you want to view the <code>index.html</code> files of that tarball, for instance the
year’s <code>index.html</code> file and then <code>1984/mullender/index.html</code> you could point your
browser to <code>1984/index.html</code>, scroll down to <code>Winning Entries of 1984 - The 1st IOCCC</code> and click on the link <code>1984/mullender</code> which will take you to the
<code>index.html</code> file. Of course the caveats listed above still will apply.</p>

<p>When the website was being worked on in 2022-2024, the hint files were changed
to README.md, which are now used to construct index.html files, most text was
converted to markdown, typos were fixed, formatting fixes were made and most
entries that no longer worked were fixed to work or partly work.</p>
<p>If you wish to find out more, and see how to see the actual differences, check

FAQ on “<a href="#detailed-diff">how to find extended details of what was changed</a>”.</p>

<h3 id="q-8.0.1-how-can-i-see-the-extended-details-of-what-was-changed">Q 8.0.1: How can I see the extended details of what was changed?</h3>
</div>
<p>We have set up make rules to easily do see what was changed in the winning IOCCC
entry source. Using the <code>Makefile</code> in the entry directory, use
one of the following <code>make(1)</code> rules:</p>
<p>The following <code>make</code> rules exist to make a difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make diff_orig_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the <em>original</em> source to the
current source (that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to <code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make make diff_alt_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alternate code to the original
code (that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>). If no alternate code exists
nothing will be shown.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_alt_prog</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the alternate code to the entry as it
stands (that is <code>entry.alt.c</code> to <code>entry.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_orig_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the original code to the alternate code
(that is <code>entry.orig.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_alt</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the alternate code (that is
<code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.alt.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>make diff_prog_orig</code>:
<ul>
<li>This rule will show the diff of the entry to the original code (that is
<code>entry.c</code> to <code>entry.orig.c</code>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For instance one of Landon’s all time favourite entries is
<a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> so the file names would be:
<code>mullender.orig.c</code>, <code>mullender.alt.c</code> and <code>mullender.c</code>. For later years, it
would be instead <code>prog.orig.c</code>, <code>prog.alt.c</code> and <code>prog.c</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you might see something like:</p>
<pre><code>    make: [Makefile:170: diff_orig_prog] Error 1 (ignored)</code></pre>
<p>at the end of the output but this is completely normal if there are differences.</p>
<p>If the alternate code is the same as the original, say with
<a href="1984/anonymous/index.html">1984/anonymous</a>, then naturally there is no point in
running the rule and the same applies for all the other rules but this system
allows for easily seeing the diffs.</p>
<p>As some examples we’ll first look at one that has really long lines which
will make it harder to see what is different,
<a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">2001/anonymous</a>. What you would do is <code>cd 2001/anonymous</code> and then do:</p>
<pre><code>    make diff_orig_prog</code></pre>
<p>and then be really confused! :-)</p>
<p>But for an entry like <a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a>, you can see the
differences much more easily. <code>1991/dds</code> is a good example where it’s very
simple to see what is different as it’s just a couple lines.</p>
<p>You might be quite surprised how little some entries had to be changed and at
the same time how much other entries had to be changed, often with quite complex
differences! In some cases if the line is rather long, like the above mentioned
one, it will be harder to see what changed but in other cases like
<a href="1984/decot/index.html">1984/decot</a> or <a href="1986/wall/index.html">1986/wall</a> it’s a
lot easier.</p>
<p>Well, at least it’s easier see the differences on a line-by-line basis but maybe
not what actually changed, especially since it’s easier to know what was fixed
when you have compiler errors :-) (though there are, as noted, some examples
where it’s quite easy to see the differences).</p>
<p><a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a> is also a good example to see the alt difference
very easily. To do that <code>cd 1991/dds</code> and then do:</p>
<pre><code>    make diff_alt_prog</code></pre>
<p>and you’ll see a single line changed and very simply.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The above mentioned <code>make</code> rules are located in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1337.mk">1337.mk</a>
include Makefile via the optional include directive line:</p>
<pre><code>    -include 1337.mk ../1337.mk ../../1337.mk</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1337.mk">1337.mk</a> file must exist in the current
directory, or under the directory above, or under the directory 2 levels
above in order for these rules to work.</p>
<p>If you’re an IOCCC masochist :-), or you really want even more details, very often the
<a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks file</a> has much more details on what had to be
changed.</p>
<h4 id="tip-if-you-have-colordiff-installed-its-a-lot-easier-to-see-the-differences">Tip: if you have <code>colordiff</code> installed it’s a lot easier to see the differences</h4>
<p>To use these rules but provide a different <code>diff</code>, for instance <code>colordiff</code>,
just do:</p>
<pre><code>    make DIFF=colordiff diff_orig_prog          # for orig to prog diff
    make DIFF=colordiff diff_alt_prog           # for alt to prog diff</code></pre>
<p>Obviously if you want to view the alternate code or the orig code you can just open
the files as described above.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Some may wonder: “Doesn’t this tamper with the entry too much?”</p>
<p>A fine line indeed has to be drawn here but it was decided that it is worth it
because of alarming warnings that can be displayed, in some systems at runtime
interspersed with the output of the program.</p>
<p>For instance in macOS the entry <a href="1990/tbr/index.html">1990/tbr</a> would output the
warning in such a way that caused confusing output for the entry, looking like:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./tbr
    $ warning: this program uses gets(), which is unsafe.
    # nothing here, what to do?</code></pre>
<p>In some cases it is not possible to fix or at least it is highly unlikely and so
those have mainly not been touched except one that has had the buffer size
increased (which could be done for others that are not possible to change to
<code>fgets()</code> though this has not been done).</p>
<p>Some entries can be made to look almost identical to the original entry. For
instance the fix to <a href="1988/reddy/index.html">1988/reddy</a> required only a single
<code>#define</code> be added.</p>
<p>In the cases it has not been done it is likely the entry can be found in the
<a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file.</p>
<p>In the future we, the judges, would prefer that entries use <code>fgets()</code> to prevent
these problems.</p>
<p>An annoying fact is that for ‘“compatibility” reasons’ <code>fgets()</code> retains the
newline and <code>gets()</code> does not. As the Unix version 7 man page used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BUGS</strong></p>
<p>The <em>fgets(3)</em> function retains the newline while <em>gets(3)</em> does not, all
in the name of backward compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re not sure how this is compatibility but either way it can cause a
problem and it is this that has complicated most of the fixes though again some
can look almost identical.</p>

<div id="consistency">
<h3 id="q-8.2-why-do-some-remarks-seem-inconsistent-with-the-entry">Q 8.2: Why do some remarks seem inconsistent with the entry?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>Because some entries had to be fixed for modern systems and often the fixes
required a change in code, sometimes significant changes. Thus the remarks can
be inconsistent in some cases.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend that when you read the remarks, sometimes the judges’
remarks and always the author’s or authors’ remarks, you look at the original
code. When the entry source code is called <code>prog.c</code> the original code is in
<code>prog.orig.c</code>; otherwise it is <code>dirname.orig.c</code>. For instance one of Landon’s all
time favourite entries is <a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> and the
original code is in <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/mullender/mullender.orig.c">mullender.orig.c</a>. In
some cases, such as <code>1984/mullender</code>, the original code is the same as the code
as no changes were made (there is an alt version for systems that are not
VAX-11/PDP-11, however).</p>

</div>
<p>Due to the fact that the original code has sometimes had to change these files
are the original winning entry or as close to as possible to the original that
we can find (in some cases a change was made by the Judges, for example, or an
author might have made a modification without saving the original).</p>

<h3 id="q-8.4-what-are-alternate-versions-and-why-were-they-added-to-some-entries">Q 8.4: What are alternate versions and why were they added to some entries?</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>The alternate versions are exactly what they sound like, versions of their
respective entries that were not the winning source code but have additional
features added (often by the author) or fixes, updates at the request of the
judges (upon winning the contest), unobfuscated versions and a variety of other
things for instance letting it work on more than one platform (where it would
not be possible to do in the original submission).</p>
<p>In some cases the alternate code added come directly from the author (some of
which already were in the website) but there were other cases where alternate
code was added that might or might not be necessary; this was a judgement call
and the reasons vary.</p>
<p>In many cases it was simply to make the entry more presentable to more people
but without modifying the entry itself, which would be tampering with the entry
(a problem that we tried to avoid as much as possible although we certainly did
not manage to do this perfectly), and in some cases it would be changing it so
much that it would no longer be what was submitted.</p>
<p>In one case an alternate version was created to help locate and fix a bug that
prevented the entry from working properly and it seemed like it should be added
as well, for fun (it is a game).</p>
<p>In some cases it might be better to not have them but as noted this was a
judgement call.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There are a number of reasons this was done but they usually come down to a
mis-feature or defect in the <code>clang</code> compiler.</p>
<p>In all versions of <code>clang</code> the first arg must be an <code>int</code> and the rest must be a
<code>char **</code> but in some versions it also objects to the number of args in
<code>main()</code>. In the versions observed that complain about the number of args it
says that there must be 0, 2 or 3 args. This only was triggered with 4 args, not
1, but to future proof the entry entries that had only one arg to <code>main()</code> were
changed to two.</p>
<p>The above also meant that some entries that were recursive calls to <code>main()</code>
could no longer be so: <code>main()</code> instead had to call another function that has
the body of the old <code>main()</code> and that function would call itself again. In some
cases, however, this had to be done even without <code>clang</code> objections.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Like with files being renamed, there are multiple reasons files were added,
removed or changed. The addition of the <code>try.sh</code> and <code>try.alt.sh</code> scripts is the most
significant example of files being added. These scripts,
help demonstrate entries by automating commands, sometimes many
commands and not always simple commands, that one would previously have to run
manually (there are other benefits as well).</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#try">try.sh and try.alt.sh</a>”
for more details.</p>
<p>Alternate code, sometimes provided by the author, sometimes provided by the
judges and sometimes other people, was added to some entries as well.</p>
<p>In the case that a link might end up with a 404 the files, if possible, were
downloaded and put into the entry’s directory. Sometimes the links were already
dead but with the help of the Internet Wayback Machine we could get the files
back.</p>
<p>In a few cases files were removed and there are multiple reasons for this too.</p>

ways.</p>

<p>Every entry has what is called the “<strong>original source file</strong>”. This is
a copy of the original source code (usually <code>prog.c</code>) that the
<a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> used when declaring that submission is a
winning IOCCC entry.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the source code (usually <code>prog.c</code>) needs
to be modified. Reasons include things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>modification as requested by the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a></li>
<li>modification as requested by the author(s)</li>
<li>modification as requested by a pull request from <a href="thanks-for-help.html">someone else</a></li>
<li>bug fix</li>
<li>portability improvement</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>We seek to preserve the “<strong>original source file</strong>”, for historical purposes,
by preserving the original source code (usually as <code>prog.orig.c</code>).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The “<strong>original source file</strong>”, because it is a historic
record, should <strong>NOT</strong> be modified.</p>
<p>Unless one can demonstrate that a mistake has been made regarding
the “<strong>original source file</strong>” and that, for some reason, the file
is <strong>NOT</strong> the original source code, please do <strong>NOT</strong> attempt to modify it.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: If you believe that the “<strong>original source file</strong>” is

<div id="renaming_files">
<h3 id="q-8.8-why-were-some-filenames-changed">Q 8.8: Why were some filenames changed?</h3>
</div>
<p>The reasons this was done varies. One of the earliest changes was making the old
<code>.hint</code> or <code>.text</code> files <code>README.md</code> files. The first time this was done was for
<code>2019/README.text</code> and <code>2020/README.text</code> with <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/87c41a787fa334f6696ec8f23284eacea63e3e89">commit
87c41a787fa334f6696ec8f23284eacea63e3e89</a>.
With <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/77fb0f11a2ddc8584a1ebe8d68fb0cccf3b959a6">commit
77fb0f11a2ddc8584a1ebe8d68fb0cccf3b959a6</a><code>index.html</code>
and <code>hint.html</code> files were removed in favour of <code>README.md</code> files;
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/commit/851e191519953c743cdd363dc19099e89210319c">commit
851e191519953c743cdd363dc19099e89210319c</a>
renamed <code>hint.txt</code> and <code>hint.text</code> to <code>README.md</code>. There were most likely other
commits that fixed some issues with this.</p>
<p>Other files were also renamed, though, sometimes being converted to markdown as
well. Shell scripts were often renamed to end with <code>.sh</code> to indicate it is a
shell script and to help browsers know how to deal with it (this was before the
method of how to display files was devised).</p>
<p>Another example is for more consistency, sometimes to do with alternate code and
other times something else.</p>
<p>There were certainly other reasons as well.</p>

please check the <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file for the IOCCC entry
in question. Note that in several cases what you may have discovered,
while a (mis)feature is not considered a bug and should <strong>not be fixed</strong>.
In cases where the bug is known, the entry’s <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file
section may offer you important fixing clues.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If you see a problem with an IOCCC entry, first check the <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a>
file. In some cases what you might think of as a bug is instead a known
feature. In some cases the bug is known, but no fix has ever been submitted.
In other cases you may have found a new problem.</p>
<p>If you do have a fix, and the <a href="bugs.html">known bugs</a> file <strong>does NOT recommend
against fixing it</strong>, then please consider opening a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> against the master
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches">branch</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">ioccc-src/winner
repo</a>.</p>
<p>BTW: A <strong>problem</strong> is not limited to the code itself. Fixing typos in files
such as “<em>index.html</em>” files (via its respective <code>README.md</code> file), fixing
issues in a “<em>Makefile</em>”, or otherwise correcting an IOCCC entry is <strong>VERY MUCH
WELCOME</strong>! Please use the same <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull

</div>
<p>First, if you do not already have a GitHub account or you have not installed an
ssh key to your account you must do so. For this we will assume you do not have
a GitHub account. For the steps following creating a GitHub account you will
have to be logged into your account.</p>
<p>To help you out here is a navigation menu in this FAQ entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub account</a></li>

<li><a href="#what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a merge</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="creating-a-github-account">Creating a GitHub account</h4>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and click on ‘Sign up’. Follow the
instructions. Once you’ve completed this task make sure you log in to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="installing-an-ssh-key-to-github">Installing an ssh key to GitHub</h4>
<p>Assuming you do not have an ssh key you should go to the command prompt and
type (if you already have one and are okay using it for GitHub you can use that
one):</p>
<pre><code>    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;luser@example.com&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where <code>luser@example.com</code> is the email you want associated with your key.
Follow the instructions. It will tell you the key files.</p>
<p>Once you have an ssh key you need to go to your <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile">account
settings</a>. Once there, in the menu
on the left you should see the item <em>SSH and GPG keys</em>. Click that and then
click (on the right side) the button that says <em>New SSH key</em>. You will see that
you have to specify a title, the key type and the PUBLIC key. Put whatever title
you want and keep the key type as <em>Authentication Key</em>. Now you need to put the
PUBLIC key in.</p>
<p>If you used an rsa key the default file will likely be found in:
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. If you used a different algorithm the file name will be
different. For instance if you used <code>ed25519</code> the default PUBLIC key file would
be <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>. If, like some people do, you have a separate key for
GitHub, it could be anything you wish, as long as it’s in <code>~/.ssh</code>. For instance
it might be <code>~/.ssh/github.pub</code>.</p>
<p>Whatever the key file is, copy the contents and paste it into the GitHub field
labelled <em>Key</em>. Once you have done so click on <em>Add SSH key</em>.</p>
<h4 id="forking-the-ioccc-winner-repo">Forking the IOCCC winner repo</h4>
<p>Open in your browser the link:
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/fork" class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/fork</a>. You now should follow the
instructions in forking the repo.</p>
<h4 id="cloning-the-ioccc-winner-repo">Cloning the IOCCC winner repo</h4>
<p>Once you have forked the repo you are ready to clone it to your system. For
instance Cody Boone Ferguson has the GitHub handle <em>xexyl</em> so he would type in:</p>
<pre><code>    git clone https://github.com/xexyl/winner [target_dir]</code></pre>
<p>Once that is completed you will need to change to that directory. The default
directory would be the name of the repo but if you specified a target directory
it will be that. For instance using the above example you might do:</p>
<pre><code>    cd winner</code></pre>
<p>You’re ready to make your changes now!</p>
<h4 id="making-changes-fixes-etc.">Making changes, fixes etc.</h4>
<p>Here you must use your wits, knowledge, creativity and whatever else you have.
Let’s say that Cody wants to update his file
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2020/ferguson1/play.sh">2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a> script. He would open it in
his editor of choice (in his case vim) and make the changes. He would then make
sure (as there is a last updated date) to update the last updated date. For
instance he might add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BTW: did you know that some people believe in snake human hybrids? It’s true! See
http://www.macroevolution.net/snake-human-hybrids.html and have a laugh, shock
or an exercise in sibilance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, assuming that the date is 1 March 2024, he would update the line that
starts with <code># Last updated:</code> to refer to <code>01 March 2024</code> rather than what it
is now (at the time of writing this), <code>15 April 2023</code>.</p>
<p>But what if he wanted to add a file? He’d create the file and then type:</p>
<pre><code>    git add foo</code></pre>
<p>where <em>foo</em> is the file to add.</p>
<p>When he’s ready to make a commit he would need to create a new branch for the
pull request.</p>
<h4 id="committing-your-changes">Committing your changes</h4>
<p>First, as an aside, if this is your first pull request (which we assume is if you’re
reading this :-) ) you need to make sure that you can push changes to GitHub
with your ssh key. To do this you need to do:</p>
<pre><code>    ssh -T git@github.com</code></pre>
<p>Cody would see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi xexyl! You’ve successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, assuming that the forked repo is
<a href="https://github.com/xexyl/winner" class="uri">https://github.com/xexyl/winner</a>, you’d type:</p>
<pre><code>    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:xexyl/winner.git</code></pre>
<p>Now you’d be ready to make your commits.</p>
<p>Before doing anything else, however, a new branch needs to be created.
Continuing the example above for
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2020/ferguson1/play.sh">2020/ferguson1/play.sh</a>, it might be that:</p>
<pre><code>    git checkout -B human-snakes</code></pre>
<p>This would change the branch to the newly created branch <code>human-snakes</code> branch.
Now Cody could commit the changes:</p>
<pre><code>    git commit play.sh # if specifying specific files
    git commit -a # if committing everything</code></pre>
<p>He could also have done:</p>
<pre><code>    git add play.sh
    git commit</code></pre>
<p>In any case this would open an editor (in his case vim) to write a commit log.
It is recommended that the first line is &lt;=51 chars and the next line is blank.
Then if necessary add a description for the log. For instance the above might
warrant the log:</p>
<pre><code>    Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh

    Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
    script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</code></pre>
<p>Now a pull request has to be opened.</p>
<h4 id="opening-a-pull-request">Opening a pull request</h4>
<p>To do this depends on the branch name. Assuming the branch from above,
<code>human-snakes</code>, you would type:</p>
<pre><code>    git push --set-upstream origin human-snakes</code></pre>
<p>This might show:</p>
<pre><code>    Enumerating objects: 9, done.
    Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
    Delta compression using up to 10 threads
    Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (5/5), 739 bytes | 147.00 KiB/s, done.
    Total 5 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), completed with 4 local objects.
    remote:
    remote: Create a pull request for &#39;human-snakes&#39; on GitHub by visiting:
    remote:      https://github.com/xexyl/winner/pull/new/human-snakes
    remote:
    To github.com:xexyl/winner.git
     * [new branch]     human-snakes -&gt; human-snakes
    branch &#39;human-snakes&#39; set up to track &#39;origin/human-snakes&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>The link referred to above would then be opened to open a pull request. Just
follow the instructions at this point. If however it does not show a link it is
likely because the branch already exists in your GitHub account (for the repo).
In this case you can open the link:
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls" class="uri">https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls</a> which might show something
like:</p>
<pre><code>    xexyl:human-snakes had recent pushes 1 minute ago</code></pre>
<p>and to the right of it you would see a button that says <em>Compare &amp; pull request</em>
which you could click on. Do that and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>An important note is if you have more than one pull request opened it’ll only
show the branch name as the summary. You should in that case copy paste the log
you put in into the website. For instance the line (on the website) <em>Add a
title</em> could have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add fun link to 2020/ferguson1/play.sh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then the text field that is labelled <em>Add a description</em> would have:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know some people believe in snake human hybrids? I added a link to the
script that discusses this and gives supposed examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you’ve done this you should click on <em>Create pull request</em>.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: although the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> will
give more deference to the authors of edited entries the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">Judges</a> also retain the final editorial say
in the matter.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-do-after-a-merge">What to do after a merge</h4>
<p>When the judges have merged the pull request you now need to make sure your fork
has the merge. To do this from the command line, assuming the fork in the above
example, you would type:</p>
<pre><code>    git checkout master &amp;&amp; git pull https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner.git master &amp;&amp; git push origin master</code></pre>
<p>This will merge your pull request to your fork.</p>

<h4 id="actual-website-problems">Actual website problems</h4>
<p>Nearly all HTML files on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC website</a>
are built from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> files.
If you see lines containing:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE - This file is generated by a tool !!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means that the file is generated by a tool from a <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory tool</a>.
You should <strong>NOT</strong> attempt to modify the file.</p>
<p>You may also find lines slightly below the above set that suggest another file to edit.
For example, in <a href="contact.html">contact.html</a>, one may read:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!! Do not modify this web page, instead modify the file: contact.md --&gt;
    &lt;!-- !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means that you could consider editing the referenced markdown file
AND then run <code>make www</code> from the top level directory in your IOCCC pull
request. There are quicker ways but to be sure you get
everything built you should do this. If you modified a markdown and you do not
see the same file as a html file then you did not complete the fix.</p>
<p>Please see the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_an_entry">fixing an entry</a>”.</p>
<p>See also the
FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>If you see in the html file:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- The main section of this web page came from JSON and other data files --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>it means that the source is <strong>NOT</strong> a markdown file; instead it might be
necessary to modify a JSON file, another data file, or, in rarer cases, a tool
in the <a href="bin/index.html">bin directory</a>.</p>
<p>If this happens, consider opening up an <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues">IOCCC issue</a>
and ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: some entries have html files <strong>NOT</strong> generated by a markdown file
and these should <strong>NOT</strong> be changed. In at least one case, other files that are
generated by markdown should <strong>ALSO NOT</strong> be updated as they are very specific
and they should only be updated by the author; an example is <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone
Ferguson</a>’s <a href="2020/ferguson1/chocolate-cake.html">Double-layered chocolate fudge
cake recipe</a>.</p>

<h3 id="q-9.6-how-can-i-correct-or-update-an-ioccc-authors-information">Q 9.6: How can I correct or update an IOCCC author’s information?</h3>
</div>
<p>You may correct or update IOCCC author information by submitting a
GitHub pull request that modifies an author’s <code>author_handle.json</code> file.</p>
<p>For example, if a given <code>author_handle.json</code> file contained:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : &quot;https://www.example.com/employee/username&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and you knew that the author has long ago left the <code>www.example.com</code> company,
and that they have a new faculty web page at <code>www.example.edu</code>, then you should
submit a GitHub pull request to change the above line to:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;url&quot; : &quot;https://www.example.edu/faculty/deartment/user.name&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Authors of IOCCC winning entries are kept in JSON files of the form:</p>
<pre><code>    author/author_handle.json</code></pre>
<p>where <code>author_handle</code> is an author handle.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#author_handle_faq">author handle</a>”
for more information about author handles.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#author_json">author_handle.json</a>”
for information about the contents of these JSON files and how they are used.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#find_author_handle">finding author handles</a>”
for how to find an <em>author_handle</em>.</p>
<p>You may update IOCCC author information in a <code>author_handle.json</code> file
by <a href="#pull_request">submitting a pull request</a>
against the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches">master branch</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">ioccc-src/winner repo</a>.</p>
<p>See the
FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: As these files are JSON you should verify that
they are validly formed (e.g., you didn’t make a typo).</p>
<p>Before you form your GitHub pull request that modifies a
<code>author_handle.json</code> file, please run the <code>make www</code> command. This
unfortunately takes quite a while but it is the safest way to do
it. So you may wish to test your edits by running the somewhat
quicker <code>make quick_www</code> as this can speed up your testing.</p>
<p>The <code>make quick_www</code> rule will update the <code>authors.html</code> and
<code>location.html</code> pages and it will also check the timestamps of the <code>index.html</code>
files versus the <code>README.md</code> files. Since they were touched and thus the
timestamp was updated, the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/bin/quick-readme2index.sh">bin/quick-readme2index.sh</a> tool would
only worry about those two files. This greatly speeds things along while testing.
Nevertheless, doing a final <code>make www</code> is still recommended best practice
before you form your pull request.</p>

FAQ on “<a href="#pull_request">GitHub pull request</a>”
for more information about pull requests.</p>
<p>As far as how to find the updated link you can try using the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback
Machine</a> and see if you can find the last non 4xx non
3xx page. Note, however, that just because it redirects, does not mean it’s not
valuable. Other times you might find it with a web search.</p>
<p>Some links were changed to more recent URLs by doing this exact
same thing. Some links, while they were a valid web page, no longer
reach the intended web page (for example when the domain is sold
and the new domain owner’s content no longer provides the content
that was originally intended .. and while the content of the web
page may be humorous to some, the original content may have literally
gone “up in smoke”).</p>
<p>In cases where the original content is lost, try searching for it on
the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a>. When searching
look back for dates that are around the year of given IOCCC contest.
If you do find the original content in Internet archive history,
please consider submitting a change to replace the link accordingly.</p>
<p>If there is no alternative that you can find you might want to remove the link
instead by replacing the link with just phrase of text. For example,
if the text in some <code>index.html</code> file was:</p>
<pre><code>    See the [author&#39;s description of the program](https://example.com) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that the author’s description cannot be found in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> archive, then
replace that text with:</p>
<pre><code>    See the **author&#39;s description of the program** (sorry the content is no longer available) for more information.</code></pre>
<p>If you just wish to report the bad link issue, see

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: <strong>many <a href="authors.html">winning authors</a></strong> have unobfuscated code
of their <strong>own entries</strong> and you should look for this first, often on GitHub or on
their website; see the FAQ on <a href="#author-information">how to find more information about a winning
author of an entry</a> for how you might find this
information. We ask you to, if you can find them, please ask them what they
think as they can often provide invaluable information; this is less of an issue
for fixes of bugs - not features - found in the <a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a> file.</p>
<p>The <a href="judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> welcome those who wish to contribute a
<strong>deobfuscated</strong> version of a winning IOCCC entry: from either the <a href="authors.html">author or
authors</a> (<strong>which is much, much preferred</strong>) or from people such
as yourself (assuming you are not the author :-) ) who are willing to contribute
<strong>deobfuscated</strong> code. We also welcome contributions to improve existing
<strong>deobfuscated</strong> code. You might wish to look at their URL or alt URL (see below
for more details) <strong>first</strong> as quite a few <a href="authors.html">authors</a> have provided
unobfuscated code of their entries and this is far more fair to the <a href="authors.html">winning
authors</a> (and it is much more likely to be identical functionality
as well, though many <a href="authors.html">authors</a> are experienced and skilled enough
to add features <strong>after or during obfuscation!</strong> and many in fact do).</p>
<p><strong>HISTORICAL NOTE</strong>: The IOCCC website has shifted to a more
educational theme: preferring to explain entries rather than hiding
things under the guise of such information being a “<em>spoiler</em>”. We
now use the term <strong>deobfuscated</strong> instead of “<em>spoiler</em>” for this reason, at
least in most cases; other terms might be used, including on a rare occasion
<em>spoiler</em>, this depending on context.</p>
<p>We ask that the <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code be <strong>identical in functionality</strong>
to the winning IOCCC entry code.</p>
<p><strong><em>PLEASE</em> NOTE</strong>: Be aware that IOCCC entry code may contain <strong>extremely subtle and
obscure side effects</strong> (i.e., features). Those wishing to contribute a
<strong>deobfuscated</strong> version of code should <strong>strive to mimic</strong> the original (or
existing) IOCCC entry code as much as possible. Some authors can be contacted
(see above for more details on this) and you could ask them for details and if
possible it would be good to include them in the discussion as well (see below)
as it is <strong>very likely</strong> there are things that will be missed when trying to
deobfuscate the code, some of which might be important to the author.</p>
<p>To contribute your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code, please open up a
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell">Show and tell new discussion</a>
with a title of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enhancement: deobfuscated code for YYYY/dirname</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where “<code>YYYY/dirname</code>” refers to the winning IOCCC entry for which you are deobfuscating.</p>
<p>In the <strong>body</strong> of your new discussion, <strong>PLEASE</strong> provide us with a <strong>URL</strong> of
your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code, along with whatever notes and/or comments you
think might be helpful. If the author has a GitHub handle <strong>please</strong> mention
them in the discussion (see above part for how you might find out if they have a
GitHub account)!</p>
<p>If you are providing an improved version of some existing <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code, please
mention that in the <strong>body</strong> of your new discussion as well.</p>
<p>If there are <strong>limitations</strong> to how well the your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code mimics
the original (or existing) IOCCC entry code, <strong>PLEASE</strong> mention those <strong>limitations</strong>
in the <strong>body</strong> of your new discussion as well.</p>
<p>Any questions that may arise will be added as comments to the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTION</strong>: <strong>PLEASE</strong> try to make your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code readable. <strong>PLEASE</strong>
add comments as needed to help the reader of your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code understand it.</p>
<p><strong>SUGGESTION</strong>: Where useful, consider providing, as <strong>C comments</strong>,
code fragments of from the original (or existing) IOCCC
entry code. While it is <strong>NOT</strong> necessary to include the entire
original code as <strong>C comments</strong>, including key parts from the
original (or existing) IOCCC entry code may be helpful
to others who wish to read your <strong>deobfuscated</strong> code.</p>

<p>We do not ‘maintain’ the contest entries as such. The code is made available on an ‘AS
IS’ basis. If you have a FIX for an entry, we suggest that you submit your fixes in a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> as we welcome pull requests that have a
minimal impact on the entry while improving the portability, functionality, and/or addressing known problems.</p>
<p>If you do submit a pull request, we ask that each pull request address just one IOCCC entry at a time.</p>
<p>Note that just because you have a fix does not mean it’ll be accepted. This
might be because the author objects or it doesn’t fit in some way or another. Of
course if the entry does not work we’ll certainly be more inclined to accept the
fix. If it is accepted we’ll be happy to credit you in the
<a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a> file. If you’re a previous author of a winning IOCCC entry we will happily
link to your entries; if you’re not we can link to your website if you wish.</p>
<p>Please see the
FAQ on “<a href="#fix_an_entry">fixing an entry</a>”

IOCCC entry. See also the

<h3 id="q-10.0-may-i-mirror-the-ioccc-website">Q 10.0: May I mirror the IOCCC website?</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a few steps in mirroring the website:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>First of all, open the website on your device, preferably one you can hold
and aim somewhere.</li>
<li>Then, turn your device towards a mirror. This should mirror it. :-)</li>
<li>If you can, take a picture of the mirror image. It might help if you can put
your device down facing the mirror, so that it is easier to get a picture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, backing up, on a more serious note: we are not accepting mirror requests at
this time, sorry. However you are free to fork the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">IOCCC winner
repo</a>.</p>
<p>Yes we are aware that some people have previously made their own repo of the
winning entries but these <strong>ARE UNOFFICIAL</strong> and <strong>VERY LIKELY</strong> out of date or
incorrect. What’s more, this repo is the source of the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org"><strong>Official</strong> IOCCC
website</a> so whenever a push is made to this repo the
<strong>Official IOCCC website</strong> is updated. When new winners are announced, this will
happen.</p>
<p>To put it simply, please do <strong>NOT</strong> fork those repos, as they are <strong>UNOFFICIAL</strong>
and certainly <strong>OUT OF DATE</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do make a new fork of <strong>THIS</strong> repo, we do ask that your fork keep up to
date with the latest changes when possible. Thank you.</p>

<p>The number of <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> has
always been “&gt; 1” such that IOCCC judges often refer to themselves
in the plural, sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural">in the common
plural</a>, sometimes in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosism">first person plural</a>, there
may be some who reject such a practice. Therefore please consider
that when you believe that just one of the <a href="judges.html">IOCCC

consider that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._D._C._Willard">F. D. C.

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/.top">.top</a> file resides at the top directory. This file contains the complete list
of IOCCC years.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC year, one will find a <code>.year</code> file. These files contain directory paths from the top directory,
of the IOCCC entry directories for a given year. For example, see the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/.year">1984/.year</a> file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/.allyear">.allyear</a> file contains the contents of all <code>.year</code> files for all IOCCC years.</p>
<p>Under each IOCCC entry directory, you will find a <code>.path</code> file.
These files contain the directory path from the top directory.
For example see <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/anonymous/.path">1984/anonymous/.path</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The IOCCC is now attempting to use the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>author</em> is someone who has submitted an entry that has won the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An entry can have more than one authors. A number of authors have submitted
entries that have won the IOCCC, sometimes in the same IOCCC contest year.</p>
<p><strong>An apology for being inconsistent</strong>: In the past, the IOCCC used the term <em>winner</em> to
refer to what is now an <em>author</em>. In a number of historical cases,
such as old rules and old guidelines, terms such as <em>winner</em> may still be
found. Moreover, out of habit, the IOCCC judges sometimes use old
names such as <em>winner</em> when they should use <em>author</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Entry</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>entry</em> is a <em>submission</em> that won the IOCCC.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> has one or more <em>authors</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>entry</em> includes all of the files needed to compile it,
plus sample input files, a <code>Makefile</code>, an <code>.entry.json</code> file
describing the entry, a compressed tarball containing all of
files in the entry, etc. Under the IOCCC tree, an <em>entry</em>
that win the IOCCC in year <em>YYYY</em> is located under the
directory <code>YYYY/entry</code>.</p>
<p><strong>An apology for being inconsistent</strong>: In the past, the IOCCC used the term <em>winner</em> to

names such as <em>winner</em> when they should use <em>entry</em>. Sorry (tm Canada)! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>submission</em> is something given to the IOCCC judges
for consideration when the IOCCC is open.</p>
<p>When the IOCCC is open for submissions, those who register
to enter the IOCCC may use the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry tool</a>
to package their code into a compressed tarball that may be
uploaded to the <a href="https://submit.ioccc.org">IOCCC submit server</a>.
This compressed tarball is formatted in such a way that
the IOCCC judges do not see who wrote the code.</p>
<p>A <em>submission</em> that the IOCCC judges deem to have won the IOCCC
becomes an <em>entry</em>. Only then do the IOCCC judges look into
the special JSON file to discover who the <em>author</em>(s) are.</p>

<div id="mobile_phone_menu">
<h5 id="menus-on-mobile-phones">Menus on mobile phones</h5>
</div>
<p>For instance, on an iPhone 14
Pro Max or similar device (in dimensions), you should see at the top right of
every page, something that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="png/ioccc-menu-mobile-phone.png"
 alt="screenshot of IOCCC menu on iPhone 14 Pro Max"
 width=1290 height=527></p>
<p>In this case click on the icon at the top right corner that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="png/hamburger-icon-open.png"
 alt="menu open icon"
 width=24 height=24></p>
<p>to activate the menu.</p>
<div id="no_javascript_menu">
<h5 id="menu-on-mobile-devices-if-javascript-is-disabled">Menu on mobile devices if JavaScript is disabled</h5>
</div>
<p>If JavaScript is disabled on any mobile device, tablet or phone, you should see
the words:</p>
<pre><code>        Please Enable JavaScript</code></pre>
<p>at the top right corner; clicking on this will take you to the <a href="nojs-menu.html">no JavaScript
menu</a> which is a plaintext menu. You of course can use this if
you like, even if you do not have JavaScript enabled, by pointing your browser
to <a href="https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/nojs-menu.html" class="uri">https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/nojs-menu.html</a>.</p>
<div id="tablet_menu">
<h5 id="menus-on-tablet-devices-e.g.-ipads">Menus on tablet devices (e.g. iPads)</h5>
</div>
<p>With tablets, it likely depends on the orientation you have your device in. If it’s
in portrait mode you likely will see the <a href="#mobile_phone_menu">menu that one will get on a mobile
phone</a>.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you are using landscape mode, say on an iPad Pro 11 inch
4th generation, then you will likely see the <a href="#desktop_menu">menu as you would on a desktop or
laptop</a>.</p>
<div id="1024px_menu">
<h5 id="menus-on-mobile-devices-wider-than-1024-pixels">Menus on mobile devices wider than 1024 pixels</h5>
</div>
<p>Finally, if you’re on a mobile device that is wider than 1024 pixels, you will
very possibly have to <strong>press and hold</strong> the menu icon:</p>
<p><img src="png/hamburger-icon-open.png"
 alt="menu open icon"
 width=24 height=24></p>
<p>to activate it. You can then use it <a href="#mobile_phone_menu">as you would on a mobile
phone</a>.</p>
<div id="browser_bug_menu">
<h5 id="browsing-the-website-on-mobile-devices-with-a-browser-bug">Browsing the website on mobile devices with a browser bug</h5>
</div>
<p>It was noticed that in iOS 16 Safari (both on an iPhone 8 Plus and in simulation
mode in macOS) the menu does not work at all. That is to say one might see:</p>
<p><img src="png/ioccc-menu-browser-bug.png"
 alt="browser bug where menu icon does not show up"
 width=1242 height=531></p>
<p>Notice how the menu icon is not even there! This happens in both portrait mode
and landscape mode.</p>
<p>In this case one will have to use the <a href="#no_javascript_menu">no JavaScript
menu</a>. If you have a fix for this that <strong>does NOT
affect the usability of desktops, laptops or other mobile devices</strong>, please
consider fixing it and <a href="#pull_request">opening a pull request</a> or at

</div>
<p>At the top of the index.html file of a winning entry with the author you want
information on, you should see a section called <code>Author</code>. All you have to do is
click on the author’s name (it’s a link) and it will take you to their
information in the <a href="authors.html">authors.html</a> page.</p>
<p>There you will find various information including a link to their
<a href="authors.html">authors.html</a> information which includes various things like
their GitHub account (if known), a URL or alternate UL, mastodon handle,
location (if known and not anonymous location) and a link to their JSON author file.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: you might wish to search google (or some other search engine) by their
name as sometimes you can find out their GitHub account even if it’s not in our
JSON files.</p>
<p>Of course if you know the author’s name you can go directly to
<a href="authors.html">authors.html</a> and click on their surname’s/last name’s/second
name’s initial and then scroll down (if necessary) to the author in question.</p>

<p><strong>It was a dark and stormy night…</strong></p>
<p>OK, let’s go back to 1984, not 1830: one day (1984 March 23 to be exact), Larry Bassel
and I (Landon Curt Noll) were working for National Semiconductor’s Genix porting
group, and we were both in our offices trying to fix some very broken code.</p>
<p>Larry had been trying to fix a bug in the classic Bourne shell (C code <code>#define</code>d
to death to sort of look like Algol) and I had been working on the <code>finger(1)</code>
program from early BSD (a bug ridden <code>finger</code> implementation to be sure).</p>
<p>We happened to both wander (at the same time) out to the hallway
in Building 7C to clear our heads.</p>
<p>We began to compare notes: ‘<em>You won’t believe the code I am trying to fix</em>’.</p>
<p>And: ’<em>Well you cannot imagine the brain damage level of the code I’m trying to
fix’</em>.</p>
<p>As well as: ’<em>It’s more than bad code, the author really had to try to make it
this bad!</em></p>
<p>After a few minutes we wandered back into my office where I posted a
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=789%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=3&amp;filter=0%22">flame to
net.lang.c</a>
inviting people to try and out obfuscate the UN*X source code we had just been working on.</p>
<p>BTW: I (Landon Curt Noll) had to post this <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=795%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=10&amp;filter=0">typo
correction</a>.
Thus began the tradition of putting typos in the contest rules and guidelines
… to make them more obfuscated of course! :-)</p>
<p>BTW: This posting was made back in the days when AT&amp;T was the evil giant.
Now, Microsoft makes AT&amp;T look mild and kind in comparison. :-( (IMHO) ).</p>
<p>BTW: See the story about the ‘<a href="1993/cmills/index.html">Bill Gates</a>’ award. :-)</p>
<p>OK, back to the story.</p>
<p>We (Larry and I) received a number of entries by email.
When we began to receive messages from outside of the US, Larry and I
decided to include International in the name.</p>
<p>The
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0">1st IOCCC entries</a>
were posted on 17 April 1984.</p>
<p>There were 4 entries that won in 1984:</p>
<ol type="1">

</ol>
<p>BTW: The (dis)honorable mention wished to remain anonymous.
While many have asked who it was, we have continued to follow the
author’s wish to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we asked the author if they still wanted to remain anonymous.
They said: ‘<em>Yes, I want to keep my anonymity. But you can tell them that I am well known for my connection to the
C language</em>’. It was not until 2001 that another <a href="2001/anonymous/index.html">anonymous
entry</a> received an award.</p>
<p>BTW: The <a href="1984/mullender/index.html">1984/mullender</a> remains one of my (Landon Curt Noll) all time favorites.</p>
<p>The name used in the posting of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=Obfuscated&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1983&amp;as_maxd=18&amp;as_maxm=4&amp;as_maxy=1984&amp;selm=837%40nsc.UUCP&amp;rnum=2&amp;filter=0">1st winning IOCCC
entry</a>
posting was <strong>I</strong>nternational <strong>O</strong>bfuscated <strong>C</strong> <strong>C</strong>ode <strong>C</strong>ontest or
<strong>IOCCC</strong> for short.</p>
<p>The posting said ‘<em>1st annual</em>’, so in 1985 we held the <a href="years.html#1985">2nd IOCCC contest</a>
and the tradition continues as the longest running contest on the Internet.</p>
<p>P.S. Part of the inspiration for making the IOCCC a contest goes to the
<a href="http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/">Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest</a>.</p>

<h3 id="q-11.1-why-are-some-years-missing-ioccc-entries">Q 11.1: Why are some years missing IOCCC entries?</h3>
</div>
<p>Some years, such as 1997, 1999, 2002-2003, 2007-2010, 2016-2017, 2021-2023, no IOCCC was held.</p>
<p>While we try to hold the IOCCC every year, sometime the other demands on the IOCCC judges
do not permit us to hold a new IOCCC.</p>
<p>The pause during the 2021-2023 period was due to the IOCCC judges developing tools to
make it much more likely for the IOCCC to be held on a yearly basis later on.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/discussions/1918">decision was made by the
IOCCC</a> to
mostly use frequent commits to individual components of the IOCCC,
rather than to use occasional site wide massive updates in order
to improve the tractability of changes made to components of the
IOCCC such as IOCCC entries although occasionally site wide updates
were performed in order to address an issue common to many IOCCC
