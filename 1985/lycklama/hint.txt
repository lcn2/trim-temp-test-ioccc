# The strangest appearing program 

Ed Lycklama

## To build:

        make all

NOTE: This entry uses non-standard args to main() that do not work with modern compilers.

## Judges' comments:

Run the program without any arguments.  Type in some very long lines
and notice how it redisplays it.

The program itself looks like tty noise.  Notice that even 'define' in #define can be defined.

NOTE: This entry requires a non-standard K&R C compiler to compile.
