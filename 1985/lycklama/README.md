## To build:

```sh
make alt
```


## To use:

```sh
./lycklama.alt < some_file
```

To see why we recommend the alternate version instead of the original version,
see below and the [Original code](#original-code) section.


## Try:

This alternate version, which we recommend you you try first, prior to the
original, slows down the output so that you can see what it looked like back in 1985.
This will be more enjoyable. It is slowed down by the `usleep(3)` library
call with a configurable time to sleep. The default is 500 microseconds but you can
reconfigure it like:


```sh
make SLEEP=700 clobber alt
```

which would set it at 700. Then, whether you use the default value or not, try:

```sh
./try.alt.sh
```


## Original code:

As explained above, because modern systems run this entry way too fast to fully
appreciate what it does, we encourage you to first try the alternate version.
After this, however, you might wish to try the original version, fixed for
modern systems.


### Original build:

```sh
make all
```


### Original use:

```sh
./lycklama < some_file
```


### Original try:

```sh
./lycklama < lycklama.c
./lycklama < lycklama.alt.c
./lycklama < lycklama.orig.c
./lycklama < Makefile
```


## Judges' remarks:

Run the program, redirecting a file into it, and notice how it redisplays it.
The program itself looks like tty noise.
