# Second year of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
to compile it and how to run the winning program.  Look at the winning source
and try to figure how it does what it does!  You may then wish to look at the
Author's remarks for even more details.

Hints against machine dependent code were added to the [rules](rules.txt) to
avoid another 1984 style entry ([1984/mullender](../1984/mullender/index.html)).
[Rules](rules.txt) and [results](../years.html#1985) were posted to
[net.lang.c](https://groups.google.com/g/net.lang.c) and
[net.unix-wizards](https://groups.google.com/g/net.unix-wizards).  Larry Bassel
was invited to help in the judging.  Awards were given to 5 classes of programs
since we were unable to select only the best 4.
