1985 marked the second year of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest.

Look at the README.md file for the given winner for information
on how to compile the winner and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

Hints against machine dependent code were added to the [rules](rules.txt) to
avoid another 1984 style winner ([1984/mullender](../1984/mullender)). Rules and
results were posted to net.lang.c and net.unix-wizards.  Larry Bassel was
invited to help in the judging.  Awards were given to 5 classes of programs
since we were unable to select only the best 4.
