```


## Judges' remarks:

Several IOCCC themes ([RPN
calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), animated
[GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) generator, [ray
tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))) in one package!
Very impressive!

The checkerboard pattern in the output can be broken. Could you figure out how?

Larger GIF files confuse some image viewers.


## Author's remarks:

### Remarks

This program renders a generic
[RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) expression in
[ray-traced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) animated
[GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) form.  The expression in spatial
variables `x` and `y` is specified on the command-line with the required
resolution, and an animated GIF showing a fly-around of the resulting surface is
output to `stdout`.

### Usage

The program should be run as:

```sh
./blakely xy* 32 > pic.gif
```

where the first parameter is a
[RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) expression, and the
second is the width of the required [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF), up
to a maximum of 250.

The expressions are written in [Reverse Polish
Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) with the
following characters recognised:

```
+, -, *, /	    - usual arithmetic operations
^		    - Exponentiation; valid for constant exponent only
s		    - sin
c		    - cos
0-9		    - single digit integers
d		    - duplicate number on stack
t		    - transpose top two elements on stack
x		    - x coordinate value
y		    - y coordinate value
```

NB: all arithmetic is done in double precision, so `23/` is two-thirds, rather
than 0.

The surface plotted corresponds to `-1 <= x,y <= 1` and for best results, the
generated `z` value should lie between `-1` and `1`.

If there is a division by zero, square-root of a negative number, or similar
operation, then the results are undefined.


### Examples

For test-runs, use a resolution of 32. For simple expressions, the
[GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) generation should take only
a few seconds with a modern processor and full optimization. Runtime scales as
[O(N^3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) with resolution `N`,
and more complex expressions take longer to compute. For example, increasing the
resolution of `ripple.gif`
to 250 took ~35 minutes to render on an [i7
processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core#Core_i7).

```sh
./blakely xy* 32 > saddle.gif

./blakely xx*yy*1++d5*ct/ 64 > ripple.gif
```


### Algorithm

A generic root-finding algorithm to find the point of intersection between a ray
and the surface is done using a simple forward search from the eye.  In order to
make the rendering realistic, both the value of the expression, and its
derivative with respect to `x` and `y` must be tracked.  This is done using an
obvious stack-based approach.


### Obfuscations

Much of the obfuscation is achieved through the use of single-letter variables
and `#define`s.  The characters output for the [GIF
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#File_format) are generated in myriad
and wonderful ways, making use of
[XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), return values from
`putchar()`, and odd expressions.  The layout is in the form of `X Y Z`.


### Limitations

ASCII is assumed since many bytes for the
[GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) output are generated from characters
given in the source code.  On compilation a few warnings about parentheses come
up when using gcc 4.6.3, and one about no return value from `main()` (who uses
exit codes anyway?), but clang 3.1 emits no warnings.


### Questions

* Apart from their appearance when computing the [RPN
expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), [sin and
cos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_and_cosine) are not used.
  How do we then get the correct angles for rotation?
* Exactly how many times will the animation repeat?
* Why is there an upper limit of 250x250 for the resolution?
* What is the point of `b[0]`?
* Where are the words `NETSCAPE` and `GIF` hidden in the source?

(Note that the author may or may not be able to answer all of the above
questions.)
