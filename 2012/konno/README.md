## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```

There is an unobfuscated version of this entry. See [Alternate
code](#alternate-code) below.


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./konno N
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh

    # you can also specify numbers to try before the random and preselected ones:
    ./try.sh 111 222 333 444 555 666 777 888 999
```

Try running [try.sh](try.sh) a number of times as the first part randomly
selects ten numbers to try.


## Alternate code:

An alternate version of this entry, [konno.alt.c](konno.alt.c), is provided.
This alternate code is an unobfuscated version of the winning code.


### Alternate build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `konno.alt` as you would `konno` above.


## Judges' remarks:

This entry is a good one-liner to analyze completely.

For extra credit, what are the minimal changes to convert it to
64-bit integers so that it could print 32 lines?


## Author's remarks:

### Remarks

This program outputs [elementary cellular
automaton](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html)
patterns.

Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./konno 30
    ./konno 90
    ./konno 102
    ./konno 109
    ./konno 165
```

There are 256 (from 0 through 255) possible rules.


### Obfuscation

This program uses bit operations. I think

``` <!---c-->
    7&O<<!o>>!o+29
```

is an interesting operation. This isn't equal to

``` <!---c-->
    7&O>>29
```

operation. What is the operation doing?


### Limitation

This program assumes that the size of `int` is 4.
