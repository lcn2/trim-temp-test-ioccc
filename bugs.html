<p>There are a number of known problems with IOCCC entries: many of
which have to do with differences between today’s compiler environments
and those of today. In some cases the original code has a bug, some
of which were recently discovered and many of which were fixed. In some cases
attempt to port older code to more modern environments introduced bugs.</p>
<p>The following is a known list of <strong>BUGS and (mis)FEATURES</strong> in IOCCC entries.</p>
<p>Can you fix/improve entries not under the INABIAF (it’s not a bug it’s a
feature)? You are <strong>VERY WELCOME</strong> to try.</p>
<p>As far as how to help: please submit your fixes in a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> (with ONE PULL
REQUEST <em>PER</em> FIX, please)!</p>
<p>We will be <strong>happy to credit anyone who submits successful <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls">GitHub pull
requests</a></strong> in the
<a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a> file. If you’re the author of an entry
that win the IOCCC, we will add a link to your winning entries in the file
(if you’re not an author, we can add a link to your GitHub page or personal
website if you have one, should you wish).</p>
<p>If you do fix an entry please feel free to delete the entry from this file!
Otherwise if you wish to not worry about it we can do that to make sure the
format is consistent and clean.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h2 id="to-the-winning-authors">To the winning authors:</h2>
<p>If you’re the author of an entry that has been fixed and you find it against
your liking <strong>PLEASE</strong> let us know and we’ll be happy to undo any fixes even if
it takes away some instructional value or even usability. _In this case we’re
<strong>VERY SORRY</strong> about it: it’s a fine line, we know, and we tried to use careful
judgement but invariably some might have been the wrong decision. Thank you for
understanding!</p>
<p>When working on getting entries to compile, sometimes some things were changed
that should not have been. Also the definition of <code>INABIAF</code> was changed a number
of times. At one point some things were changed to a bug (a usability problem
for example) to be fixed but when looking at the index.html file it was noticed
it was documented so the fixes were undone at that point.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="on-all-fixes-improvements-changes">ON <strong>ALL</strong> FIXES / IMPROVEMENTS / CHANGES</h3>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you test the entry <em>BEFORE</em> <strong>AND</strong> <em>AFTER</em> your
changes! This includes output and the same input functionality! Sometimes it
might seem to be fine but is actually not! We will note some where this is known
to happen (if it’s not yet fixed). This has actually already happened to us.
Sometimes it is okay: some entries are known to not work but they can still have
improvements (rarer situation but it’s happened). Some might have slightly
different output but which is not a problem for instance a newline after output.
This is not the most ideal but it is okay.</p>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you read the index.html file <em>BEFORE</em> your changes
as it’s important to see that the code is doing what it is supposed to. In the
case that it’s not obvious (some index.html files do not even have commands to
try or even explain how to use it!) then you should either skip the entry OR ask
someone who will know for instance the Judges.</p>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you read the next section, the list of statuses
and the related information, BEFORE you submit a pull request!</p>
<p><strong>BE VERY AWARE</strong> that sometimes fixing an entry for one platform will break it
under another so if you have more than one platform (e.g. macOS and linux) it
would be wise to test it under all that you have access to. Otherwise we can do
that. Of course if the entry does not work under any platform and you fix it for
one that’s more than fine (and it has been done numerous times).</p>
<p>Again, THANK YOU!</p>

<p><strong>BTW</strong>: You may skip if you’re only interested in knowing about entries with known issues.</p>
<p>Entries below have one or more of the following <em><strong>STATUS</strong></em> values. Please see
the text below for more information. If an entry has more than one status it
means that either they all apply or they complement each other.</p>

<h2 id="general-notes-about-the-statuses-and-making-fixes">General notes about the statuses and making fixes</h2>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="compiler-warnings-are-very-rarely-a-problem">Compiler warnings are very rarely a problem</h3>
<p>In general warnings should NOT be addressed. The only time they should be
CONSIDERED is when the entry does not work. However note that sometimes trying
to fix the warnings will actually introduce bugs! Other times ‘fixing’ them will
break the entry (see below).</p>
<p>Below in some entries we do list some warnings that definitely should be ignored
(including some introduced by fixes) but we do not list them all: trying to keep
track of them all would be impractical especially as different compilers give
different warnings.</p>
<p>Another type of warning that would be hard to keep track of is different data
sizes on different platforms. These tend to be required at the risk that
sometimes the entry will not work for certain platforms, some of which might or
might not be fixable; a good example where it was required to change and is okay
is the fix of the segfault in macOS of
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1989/paul/paul.c">1989/paul</a>: changing the <code>int *</code> to a <code>long *</code>
was required and it works just as well with linux.</p>
<p>But even if they are fixable (which will likely be hard to do) it’s almost
certain that such code would be just as non-portable (importable ? :-) ).</p>
<p>In rare cases they are valid. For instance in linux the following
warning in <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1985/applin/applin.c">1985/applin</a> with gcc:</p>
<pre><code>    applin.c:1:78: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function &#39;execlp&#39; [-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch]
        1 | main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]=strdup(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);(!!c)[*c]&amp;&amp;(v--||--c&amp;&amp;execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));**c=!c)write(!!*c,*c,!!**c);}
          |                                                                              ^~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>and this is is kind of like the fix to
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/anonymous/anonymous.c">1984/anonymous</a>. In the case of <code>1984/anonymous</code> it
was a bit more involved but with <code>1985/applin</code> one need only add to the Makefile
<code>-include unistd.h</code>. So there are some cases where fixing warnings can fix a
problem but in general they should be ignored even if they’re annoying.</p>
<p>Hopefully with the example entries listed above you get the idea.</p>

<h3 id="general-request-on-original-code">General request on original code:</h3>
<p>If you’re fixing an entry please make as <em>FEW CHANGES AS POSSIBLE</em>! This is to
make it as close to the original but allowing it to work. This might be less of
a problem when providing alternate versions but it might still be nice to have
it as close as possible to the original. See also below two points.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="request-for-one-liners">Request for one-liners:</h3>
<p>For one-liners <em>PLEASE KEEP THE FILE ONE LINE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE</em>! See the
<a href="next/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> for what constitutes a one-liner. If it needs an
include you can update the Makefile <code>CINCLUDE</code> variable. For instance if it
needs <code>stdio.h</code> you could do <code>-include stdio.h</code>. Please leave a space after the
<code>=</code> in the Makefile. You may also have extra long lines if this seems useful to
make it a one-liner even if it kind of makes it longer than what the judges
consider a one-liner, at least within reason. Thank you!</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="on-layout-of-program-source">On layout of program source:</h3>
<p>If you make changes <em>PLEASE TRY AND KEEP THE SOURCE CODE LAYOUT AS CLOSE TO THE
ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE</em>. This might not always be possible and if you have an
editor that does formatting it can cause problems. Sometimes formatters can even
break code! Some have experienced this many times with vim so he tends to
disable all format options when formatting code. In vim you should be able to do
that with:</p>
<pre><code>    :set formatoptions=</code></pre>

<p>An important point to note is that there is a very fine line when fixing bugs

these are not meant to be maintainable or even good programming style! Use
careful judgement when fixing bugs please!</p>

<p><strong>Please help test, and if necessary fix this bug</strong>!</p>
<p>Entries with this status might or might not have a bug possibly depending on the

because we do not remember and sometimes we don’t have the appropriate system or
environment to test and fix any possible problems.</p>

<h2 id="status-doesnt-work-with-some-platforms">STATUS: doesn’t work with some platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Please help us fix this bug</strong>!</p>
<p>Entries with this status do not work under some OSes and/or architectures (and/or
something else?). Please help us to fix it!</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h2 id="status-doesnt-work-with-some-compilers">STATUS: doesn’t work with some compilers</h2>
<p><strong>Please provide alternative code or fix for more compilers</strong>!</p>
<p>Some entries do not work with some compilers. A good example is
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1992/lush/lush.c">1992/lush</a> which uses error messages from the compiler to
generate its output.</p>
<p>If you can provide code that works for multiple compilers without too much
tampering this is okay though it’s probably not possible with the above
mentioned entry; otherwise it would be better to provide alternate code. In some
cases it might be better to provide alternate code anyway. Use a judgement call
here as best you can manage.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h2 id="status-main-function-args-not-allowed">STATUS: main() function args not allowed</h2>
<p><strong>Please help us fix the main() function</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: it appears that most if not all of these have been fixed except perhaps
for <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1989/westley/westley.c">1989/westley</a> but this has probably been fixed as
much as possible given the nature of how it generates code: the entry itself
compiles but two versions of code it generates does not work with clang.</p>
<p>However some still might have problems of some kind or another and some might
not yet be located as an additional defect of clang was noticed where <code>main()</code>
is not allowed four args or one arg (see below).</p>
<p>This is what the status means, however.</p>
<p>Entries with this status have a problem in that the args to main() are not of a
specific type or there are too many due to this being allowed in earlier C. Some
compilers like clang have a defect where they do not allow this and some
versions have an additional defect where they only allow 0, 2 or 3 args, the
latter of which affected <code>1989/westley</code>, so these entries do not work with
clang.</p>
<p>Looking at the source
code of clang, it appears that there is no way to override the requirement of
arg types so these entries will fail to compile with clang. That’s why in some
entries the fix was done with a new function, often called <code>pain()</code> :-)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE for macOS users</strong>: please be aware that <em>gcc</em> under macOS <strong>is actually
clang</strong> despite the fact it might appear to be gcc: no symlink and both gcc and
clang exist but the gcc is clang which you’ll see if you run <code>gcc --version</code>.</p>
<p>A tip and some fix methods: in the older days args to <code>main()</code>
not given a type were implicit <code>int</code>s but when they’re required to be <code>char **</code>
this can cause a problem. In some cases it was possible to use a <code>char *</code> inside
<code>main()</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1989/tromp/tromp.c">1989/tromp/tromp.c</a> and
<a href="1986/holloway/index.html">1986/holloway/holloway.c</a> for two examples though
done slightly differently). In other cases it was possible to dereference the
pointers to be used like an int and other times a cast was necessary. There are
various techniques to get these to compile. In some cases this introduced a
problem but typically if not always that problem exists with compilers that are
less strict.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h2 id="status-main-has-only-one-arg">STATUS: main() has only one arg</h2>
<p><strong>Please help modify so that main() as 2 or 3 args</strong>!</p>
<p>Because some versions of clang complain about the number of args of <code>main()</code> and
in particular say (when it has four, for instance) that it’s only allowed to
have 0, 2 or 3 args, numerous entries had a second arg added to <code>main()</code> (if
they only had one). This is in case clang adds further restrictions which is not
impossible especially as it already claims having only one arg is not allowed.
At this time (04 Feb 2024) there is one entry known (it is possible that not all
were checked) that has this problem but it’s not as simple as the others to fix
without breaking it.</p>

<h2 id="status-compiled-executable-crashes">STATUS: compiled executable crashes</h2>
<p><strong>Please help us fix this bug</strong>!</p>
<p>While such entries can compile, the resulting executable sometimes or always
crashes.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this does NOT apply to entries under the INABIAF status (though they’re
not mutually exclusive in some cases).</p>
<p>REMINDER: if you’re debugging a crash it will be very helpful to have <code>-O0 -g</code>
or if you can <code>-ggdb3</code> when compiling as that will help with debugging symbols.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h2 id="status-uses-gets">STATUS: uses gets()</h2>
<p><strong>Please help us change use of gets() to fgets()</strong>, if possible.</p>
<p>Entries with this status use <code>gets()</code> which is unsafe because it has no limit on
the length of the string. Many were fixed but not all.</p>
<p>There’s a very good reason for this change even though it is bordering on tampering
entries: in modern systems one will get possibly alarming and certainly annoying
warnings during at least one of compiling, linking and execution. In macOS it’s
most annoying as it happens during execution (also compilation) with the warning
being interspersed with the output of the program, often causing confusing
output with the entry. A good example that was fixed is
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1990/tbr/tbr.c">1990/tbr</a>.</p>
<p>Some important notes on this status with respect to fixing / changing the
entries:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>In some cases changing the entry to use <code>fgets()</code> will break the entry and in
some cases cause it to crash. Where this is known we will document it.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>MUST</strong> check the output before and after to make sure that it remains
the same. Sometimes the output might not be immediately obviously wrong but is.
We will document known examples as we come across them.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gets()</code> does NOT STORE the <code>'\n'</code> but <code>fgets()</code> DOES! This is one of the
reasons some of the entries break when changed to <code>fgets()</code>. Some of those have
been fixed but there are others that have not been.</p></li>
<li><p>Just because you don’t see the string <code>gets</code> in the code does not mean it’s
not used. It is after all the International <em>Obfuscated C Code</em> Contest! :-)
Sometimes it will be in the Makefile and other times it will be obfuscated in
other ways; a good example of that that was fixed is
<a href="1991/dds/index.html">1991/dds</a>: in this case the string was encrypted.
Compilers and linkers tend to warn about its use (and as noted in macOS it also
happens at execution) and this is a good way to find entries that use it even if
it’s not visible in the code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this status is <em>NOT necessarily mutually exclusive</em> with the <em>INABIAF</em>
(it’s not a bug it’s a feature) status. The reason for this is due to warnings
during compiling, linking and/or runtime, sometimes causing confusing output (as
noted above).</p>
<p>Sometimes <code>getline(3)</code> will work but note that this function also stores the
newline just like <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="status-missing-files">STATUS: missing file(s)</h2>

cases the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> will be very

<h3 id="inabiaf-its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature--">INABIAF: It’s not a bug it’s a feature :-)</h3>
<p>Entries with this status should NOT be touched (unless they have another status
that suggests that <em>that</em> issue can be changed): they are system specific by
design or are other things that are not actually bugs or bugs even if they
appear to be. Or they might be documented bugs or things that simply are part of
the entry. Nonetheless they are noteworthy.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the definition of this status changed over time. At one point it was when
something was noted by the author, the judges, a consequence of earlier
requirements for winning entries or the purpose was to do something that might
appear to be buggy. An example of system specific entries:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1984/mullender/mullender.c">1984/mullender</a> (see below for a
version that works in modern systems) is very system specific and was before
system specific winning entries were discouraged. This is an all time personal
favourite of Landon Curt Noll. Run the alternate code to understand why this
might be (along with how strange the source code is :-) ).</p>
<p>An example where a crash is not a bug: <a href="2019/endoh/index.html">2019/endoh</a> is
supposed to crash. There are others that are also supposed to crash or that are
known to segfault but are considered features.</p>
<p>An important note is that if the index.html of the entry has a bug status that
says it can be fixed it can be. Otherwise it should not be.</p>
<p>Nonetheless we challenge you to fix these entries for educational/instructional
value and/or enjoyment but we kindly request that you <strong>DO NOT</strong> submit a pull
request unless it’s a bug or (mis)feature we would like you to fix!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: in the case of <code>gets()</code> we’ve fixed some to avoid the warning of the
compiler, linker or even during runtime, depending on the system. In <a href="1990/tbr/index.html">some cases
like 1990/tbr</a> the fix actually prevents confusing output (though that
was not the only fix made in that entry).</p>

details) with a number &lt; 0 or larger than, say 20, it’s very likely that the
program will turn into an infinite loop trying to compile code and end up with
with syntax errors. As this was documented it is not a bug to be fixed.</p>

<p>This program will very likely crash or break into tiny bits :-) if you feed it
numbers with non-binary digits.</p>
<p>There are also other cases where this can happen for instance using unsupported
operators like <code>/</code>. To see what operators are supported check the source code.</p>

<p>With version 2 it sometimes segfaults even with the same input where other times
it does not. We don’t believe this is because of the fix that lets some versions
be compiled with clang. An example invocation is:</p>
<pre><code>    ./ver2 &lt; westley.c</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-useful-note-on-changingfixing-this-program">A useful note on changing/fixing this program</h3>
<p>It should be noted that in additional to rot13 names there is code that is the
reverse of other code (also with respect to names). See the source file and the
index.html (in the author’s remarks) for more details.</p>
<p>Fixing the (mis)feature is likely to be a very difficult challenge especially
without breaking something else which is far more likely (see below tips from).
You are welcome to try and fix it if you can but unless you can get all to
compile with <code>clang</code> <strong>AND</strong> <code>gcc</code>, which seems unlikely (see below), this
should not be touched further. Nonetheless you are welcome to try and fix it if
you can.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that even if you can get it to compile with both <code>gcc</code> and
<code>clang</code>, different versions will have errors so that it’s not actually a fix.
For instance it was fixed to work for both <code>clang</code> and <code>gcc</code> but when testing
the fix in fedora linux it failed to even compile!</p>

<p>The reason this is crashing is that the array <code>irk</code> is being accessed way out of
bounds by the int <code>gnat</code>. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>    Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    #0  0x0000000000401335 in main (ABBA@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, tang@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, gnat@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, Near@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)

<h3 id="magic-of-the-entry">Magic of the entry:</h3>
<p>The real trouble is that the code is generated and in a complex way or rather
ways.</p>
<p>Trying to explain this might be tricky but here is an attempt. The program, when
used without any args, will print out what it reads. If one arg is specified it
will do a ROT13 of it. If two args are specified it will print out the text
backwards (<em>WITHOUT ROT13!</em>). If three args are specified it will do both
<strong><em>reversal AND ROT13</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So <code>ver0</code> is the same as the main program; <code>ver1</code> is the ROT13 of the code (but
see below); <code>ver2</code> will reverse the code and <code>ver3</code> will both reverse and ROT13
the code. But it’s trickier than that as one might expect.</p>
<p>The comments are processed too. Furthermore it happens that the last line
becomes the first and the first line becomes the last! Now if you look at the
code you’ll see on the first line:</p>
<pre><code>    /**//*/};)/**/pain(*//**/tang         ,gnat/**//*/,ABBA~,0-0(avnz;)0-0,tang,raeN</code></pre>
<p>In <code>ver0</code> it’ll be the same but the others are more interesting.</p>
<p>In <code>ver1</code> you’ll see on the last line:</p>
<pre><code>    cnva((vag)NOON&amp;2/*//*\\**/,gnat,tang        ,NOON/**//*/(niam/**/);}/*//**/</code></pre>
<p>and on the first line:</p>
<pre><code>    /**//*/};)/**/cnva(*//**/gnat         ,tang/**//*/,NOON~,0-0(niam;)0-0,gnat,enrA</code></pre>
<p>Observe that the ROT13 of <code>pain</code> is <code>cnva</code> and the ROT13 of <code>main</code> is <code>znva</code>.
The ROT13 of <code>NOON</code> is <code>ABBA</code>. <code>vag</code> is ROT13 of <code>int</code>, <code>gnat</code> and <code>tang</code> are
ROT13 of each other as well which is the reverse of the original (this is not
because it goes backwards (it doesn’t in this version) but because they are
ROT13 pairs!). <code>main</code> spelt backwards is <code>niam</code> and <code>pain</code> spelt backwards is
<code>niap</code>. Furthermore see the Makefile for other defines that had to be specified
and for <code>ver2</code> and <code>ver3</code> (that both work with gcc) one had to be undefined (search
for <code>CDEFINE</code> and <code>-U</code>). These details will be important momentarily.</p>
<p>As far as <code>NOON</code> and <code>ABBA</code> being ROT13 pairs, notice how <code>NOON</code> is not in the
original code but <code>ABBA</code> is; but in other versions it becomes <code>NOON</code> and they
also have <code>abba</code> which the original code does not!</p>
<p>Now notice how the <code>avnz</code> in the first line got changed to <code>niam</code>, its ROT13
value. Notice also how some of these are in comments!</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is in there somewhere and that had to be changed to call
<code>pain()</code> (see the <a href="thanks-for-help.html#1989_westley">thanks</a>
file (see the <em>1989/westley</em> section for details on how as this was
not as straight forward as it is for other entries) as well. Now
if you notice on that line you have in a comment <code>niam</code>. If you
were to change that to <code>niap</code> (pain backwards) that function would
end up as <code>pain()</code> in generated code! That’s assuming that it’s
just the reversal version, of course but ver1 is the ROT13 version.</p>
<p>These facts are bad enough but then you throw in the reverse of it without ROT13
and then another version that has the reversal <em>and</em> ROT13 then you can see it’s
nigh impossible to fix if not impossible.</p>
<p>The fix to get it to even compile with clang and then get the first two
(counting the original, <code>ver0</code>) to work was quite hard due to how the comments
in reverse and ROT13 of it all works together, especially allowing all versions
to compile with gcc. The only reason that it doesn’t work completely with clang
is the arg types of main() (see if you can figure out how the change of <code>main()</code>
in <code>westley.c</code> is not carried over to versions 2 and 3!); originally none of
them compiled with clang.</p>
<p>But it was possible to get the ROT13 code to compile with clang but the other
versions, reversed as well as ROT13 and reversed code, proved much more
problematic. It is now possible to compile (or maybe mostly compile) all versions with
clang but on another system and it had syntax errors.</p>
<p>Enjoy! :-)</p>

<p>A point worth considering is that as the number passed into the program gets
bigger the number of lines of output gets substantially larger and it takes much
more time and resources to run as well. For instance:</p>

<p>Some issues in this program were fixed and <a href="authors.html#Yusuke_Endoh">Yusuke

there is a bug in this entry. The judges wrote that to test the entry one can
do:</p>
<pre><code>    echo &quot;Quartz glyph jocks vend, fix, BMW.&quot; | compress | ./btoa | ./jaw</code></pre>
<p>which should apply the identity transformation to a minimal holoalphabetic

<p>If one does, however:</p>

<p>they will get just</p>

<p>which seems to be an error message (one of the fixes was to make it not use
<code>perror(3)</code> - this fixed something else though it’s no longer known what except
that in macOS if <code>errno</code> is 0 it reports what looks like an error, rather than
success in, say, linux).</p>
<p>The script <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/1990/jaw/shark.sh">shark.sh</a> has some issues too in that due to
path not having <code>.</code> (this and maybe some other things were fixed) and <code>tar</code> not
wanting to accept reading from <code>stdin</code> (this in particular) even with the right
options used, seemingly, it has to write to disk the tarball which seems to
defeat the purpose. This would ideally be fixed.</p>

<p>Many bugs that prevented this from working properly (including segfaults) were
fixed but one thing to note is that if you pass two zeroes to <code>theorem_bkp</code> or
<code>fibonacci</code> the program will enter an infinite loop, printing 0 over and over
again; another condition where this occurred was fixed but this one should not

<p>Although this was fixed to not enter an infinite loop if the arg (converted to
a number) is &lt; 0 the lack of an arg check at all was kept in to make it like the
original. The reason for the &lt; 0 check is it floods the screen (yes this is
indeed inconsistent with some other entries but it is not worth the time spent,
maybe, to change it back, especially as it is annoying to have the screen
flooded).</p>

<p>The author stated that if the file cannot be opened then it will print a system
error but this is not the case unless it’s showing a fault. This was fixed as
part of another problem that was detected.</p>
<p>Also, if <em>some</em> of the programs are not given an arg they will very likely crash
or do something funny. For instance <code>adsleep</code> and <code>adbasename</code>. This is very
simple to fix but the author explicitly noted that this will segfault and it is
that that is the error message.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the code:</p>
<pre><code>    printf((W,Y));</code></pre>
<p>appears to be wrong because <code>W</code> is a <code>FILE *</code> and <code>Y</code> is a <code>char[]</code> but if one
changes it to use <code>fprintf()</code> on the file (which, incidentally, is opened in
read only mode which is another reason) with the <code>%s</code> specifier it will make
<code>adhead</code> not work: it’ll print nothing at all! So this code should not be
changed either even if it appears to be wrong. Notice too a curious thing: if
you did change it to <code>fprintf()</code>, even if you have the right number of args, you’d
have to remove the outer <code>()</code> pair.</p>

<p>Leo Broukhis, before he was an IOCCC judge, sent the IOCCC judges an email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: leo <em>at</em> zycad -dot- com (Leo Broukhis)<br>
Date: Tue, 30 Jan 96 17:37:51 PST<br>
To: judges <em>at</em> toad -dot- com<br>
Subject: IOCCC 1992 - a bug<br></p>
<p>Dear Judges,</p>
<p><code>albert.c</code> (even in its fixed form) still has a bug. Although I don’t
remember the number that exposed the bug (afair, resulting in coredump)
in <code>albert.orig.c</code> that has been fixed in <code>albert.c</code>,</p>
<p>I’ve found a number exposing another bug: 10000000001 (that’s 9 0’s).
Both albert and albert.orig loop without printing anything, although
the first factor is 101 and is usually found in an instant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick debugging session suggests that the problem with this value
is that:</p>
<pre><code>    if ( ppp-&gt;qq!=48 ) return;</code></pre>
<p>is never reached because the value is never 48 (it is in other cases but not for
the example input). It varies in value at this point. Observe that the next
lines of code are:</p>
<pre><code>    while ( ppp-&gt;qq==48 )
    {
        printf(&quot;%ld\n&quot;,qqq-45);
        *pp = ppp;
        ppp = ppp-&gt;p;
    }</code></pre>
<p>so it is expected that that value is 48, before printing the numbers, but if
it’s not it should not proceed at all, not even to go past that loop. In other
words that loop should always be entered for at least one iteration. The check
for the <code>!= 48</code> is also required.</p>
<p>Perhaps more useful to know is that at this point in the code the code:</p>
<pre><code>    if ((((( !(aa=setjmp(ppp-&gt;ppp))||aa==aaaaaa )))))</code></pre>
<p>appears to be entered because of the return value of <code>setjmp()</code>, not the other
condition.</p>
<p>The alt version does fix the problem but it is not obfuscated and not like the
entry itself. Can you fix the actual entry? You are welcome to try and do so.</p>

<p>This code uses <code>gets(3)</code> on a buffer size of 256 to read from the dictionary. It
is highly unlikely that a line in a dictionary file will be this long but it
could happen and it would be ideal if the code used <code>fgets(3)</code> instead.
Unfortunately with this entry it’s not as simple due to how <code>gets(3)</code> is used,
which can be described simply as: first <code>m</code> is set to <code>*++p</code> in a for loop where
<code>p</code> is argv. Later <code>m</code> is set to point to <code>h</code> which was of size 256. <code>gets(3)</code>
is called as <code>m = gets(m)</code>) but trying to change it to use <code>fgets(3)</code> breaks the
program.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the author noted the following bugs and limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no error checking.</li>
<li>Standard input must be seekable, so you can’t pipe the dictionary into <code>AG</code>.</li>
<li>The input sentence and each line in the dictionary may contain at most 32
distinct letters, and each letter may occur at most 15 times.</li>
<li>Words in the dictionary may be at most 255 bytes long.</li>
<li><code>AG</code> cannot handle characters that sign-extend to negative values.</li>
<li>Although <code>AG</code> works on both 16-bit and 32-bit machines, the size of the problems
it can solve is severely limited on machines that limit the stack size to 64k or
less.</li>
</ul>
<p>… so whether or not the <code>gets(3)</code> should be changed to <code>fgets(3)</code> is up to
debate.</p>

<p>This was fixed but it only properly works with gcc; it was also changed to use
<code>fgets()</code> instead of <code>gets()</code> and a script was provided to run the entry
properly. Nonetheless it will only work with gcc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the way the entry works and the fact that other compilers
like clang have different warnings and errors this simply does not work with
them.</p>
<h4 id="some-tips">Some tips:</h4>
<p>This entry relies on specific compiler warnings. With gcc it will look something
like:</p>
<pre><code>    [...]
    lush.c: In function &#39;main&#39;:
    lush.c:40: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
       40 |           main
          |
    lush.c:1: note: this is the location of the previous definition
        1 | #define gets(_) fgets((_),999,stdin)
          |
    lush.c:42: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
       42 | #define f 001:
          |
    lush.c:40: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       40 |           main
          |
    lush.c:44: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
       44 | #define f 100:
          |
    lush.c:42: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       42 | #define f 001:
          |
    lush.c:45: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
       45 |          _[i--
          |
    lush.c:44: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       44 | #define f 100:
          |
    lush.c:46: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
       46 | #define f 126:
          |
    lush.c:45: note: this is the location of the previous definition
       45 |          _[i--
          |</code></pre>
<p>Now one can use <code>sed</code> to get the <code>warning:</code> line correct but there is more to it
than that. For instance this is what it looks like with clang:</p>
<pre><code>    lush.c:40:9: warning: &#39;f&#39; macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]
    #define f 001:
            ^
    lush.c:1:9: note: previous definition is here
    #define f 000:
            ^
    lush.c:42:9: warning: &#39;f&#39; macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]
    #define f 100:
            ^
    lush.c:40:9: note: previous definition is here
    #define f 001:
            ^</code></pre>
<p>As you might see the part under the <code>warning:</code> line is different.</p>
<p>The entry is supposed to show warnings and then print:</p>
<pre><code>    Hello World.</code></pre>

<p>This was fixed to compile with modern systems but the entry also used <code>gets(3)</code>
which in some systems would print out a warning along with the output of the
program. Naturally it could also overflow long lines, of which there are many,
though that is more considered a feature, not a bug, as it was documented by the
author.</p>
<p>It was changed to use <code>fgets(3)</code> to prevent the display problem but this introduces
another problem namely that newlines can be printed if the line length &lt; 231.</p>
<p>This seems like a worthy compromise to not have messed up output and although it
would be ideal for it to never print a newline (unless that’s the line itself)
it might be tampering too much with the entry to fix this problem, as it’s not a
real problem and as a one liner it’s already quite long.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the generated code of all versions, when fed its own source, will differ
even when it works. See the author’s remarks in the index.html for details.
Increasing the buffer size and having it, when fed its own source code,
generate code that will compile with the same buffer size is difficult: it just
uses the original size. This is explained later down.</p>
<p>Getting it to use <code>fgets()</code> is even harder as when fed its own code it will
generate code that cannot even compile let alone use <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<p>In both cases, changing the buffer size and changing it to use <code>fgets(3)</code>, will
cause compilation errors without other adjustments.</p>
<p>See the below magic for details. Along with the author’s remarks in the
index.html file it might prove possible to get it to use <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the magic of how this entry works, to help anyone who wishes to work on
this.</p>
<p>You might wish to run the commands:</p>
<pre><code>    diff schnitzi.alt.c schnitzi.alt2.c

    diff schnitzi.alt2.c schnitzi.alt.c</code></pre>
<p>to see how the buffer size and how the <code>gets(3)</code> was changed to use <code>fgets()</code>,
in the two alternate versions. Notice that the <code>fgets(3)</code> version can compile it
just can’t <strong>generate</strong> compilable code (let alone using <code>fgets(3)</code>) when fed
itself (to reiterate, just changing the call to <code>fgets(3)</code> does not mean it can
compile and there’s a further problem in that <code>fgets(3)</code> retains the newline
whereas <code>gets(3)</code> does not). Nevertheless looking at these commands will be of
help to understand how it works, in case one wishes to try and fix it.</p>
<p>For the alternate versions the other functionality is unaffected.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-1994schnitzi-and-how-it-flips-text">The magic of <a href="1994/schnitzi/index.html">1994/schnitzi</a> and how it flips text</h3>
<p>The problem is getting the generated code to use <code>fgets()</code> (once it even
compiles which was easy to do) and also have the updated buffer size be the
same (which was easy to do too at least in the original version). The generated
output, when changed to <code>fgets()</code> failed to compile and it also used <code>gets(3)</code>
and these are the bugs here.</p>
<p>The buffer size, when using <code>gets()</code> is still the same but as noted above the
original code has had a buffer size increase.</p>
<p>The real problem is with formatting the code. Take a look at the <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, <code>int r=0,x,y=0</code> and the interesting comment below it, at the top of
the file.</p>
<p>If you look at each column and go down that column you can see how it spells out
the code! For instance the first column looks like:</p>
<pre><code>    #
    i
    n
    c
    l
    u
    d
    e

    &lt;
    s
    t
    d
    i
    o
    .
    h
    &gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you join the lines you end up with:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you look at column 25 which is the end of the word ‘mh111’ and you go down to
the next row you’ll see a 0 and if you go one row down another 0. This is the
buffer size, 100, for <code>u</code>! The column to the left is the same for the <code>t</code>
variable.</p>
<p>Thus it seems that in order to get the generated output correct one needs to
provide the correct input in comments or possibly by rearranging some of the
code (this was actually required to make the generated code compile at all when
changing the buffer size, see below).</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h3 id="important-points">Important points:</h3>
<p>Getting this entry to use <code>fgets(3)</code> is easy but the problem is you’re supposed
to be able to feed the source to the program and the output of that will be
compilable. It however will create compiler errors. So it’s not just changing
the code to get it to use <code>fgets(3)</code>! This was done but
the other part is why that part was rolled back. The buffer size was increased
but that only works on the original source.</p>
<p>To say just how sensitive this entry is: even a space, lack of space or a
character, wrong character, lack of character or character in the wrong place
can cause a compilation error! Make sure that the output of:</p>
<pre><code>    ./schnitzi &lt; schnitzi.c</code></pre>
<p>can be compiled and the output of that new program when fed itself can also be
compiled!</p>

<h3 id="important-reminder-and-a-note-about-the--1-value-check-for-getc">Important reminder and a note about the <code>-1</code> value check for <code>getc()</code>:</h3>
<p>This code was fixed to not use <code>-1</code> for the return value of <code>getc()</code>; this is
important because <code>EOF</code> is <strong>NOT</strong> guaranteed to be <code>-1</code> but rather any negative
value. On systems where <code>EOF != -1</code> the program would enter an infinite loop
until the program crashed, by chance reads a <code>-1</code> or was killed (it is for this
same reason that one should not use <code>EOF</code> for the <code>getopt()</code> functions as they
return <code>-1</code> when all options are parsed (for details on the definition of <code>EOF</code>
see <code>7.21 Input/output&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> subsection 1 of the standard)).</p>
<p>An interesting problem occurred where changing the <code>-1</code> to <code>EOF</code> caused both
<code>warning: illegal character encoding in string literal</code> and <code>error: source file is not valid UTF-8</code>. But since <code>EOF</code> is simply an int &lt; 0 and making the loop
condition check that the return value is &gt;= 0 does not cause a compilation error
and it functions correctly it will address the systems where <code>EOF != -1</code> just as
if it checked for <code>!= EOF</code>.</p>
<p>Since it works there is no need to fix this except for a challenge to yourself.</p>

<p>The judges said the following in their remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fractally minded may be able to detect that mode 0 does not calculate
Mandelbrot/Julian sets correctly. Can you find the bug? Better still, can you
fix it without breaking something else?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the author stated that this is a feature so this should not be fixed.

<p>This did not originally compile under macOS and after it did compile under
macOS, it crashed. These problems were fixed.</p>
<p>It should be noted however that there is a condition where the program will
prompt you to press return again. This was thought to be a bug but looking at
the code it can clearly be seen that if <code>g - a</code> is 0 then the message is
supposed to be printed again and one is supposed to press a key as at that point
it calls <code>getchar()</code> via the pointer <code>m</code>. So this is a feature not a bug.</p>

<p>The author stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Memory <code>malloc(3)</code>ed is never freed. This shouldn’t be a big deal, since only
one block is ever allocated, and the OS should recover it.</p>
<p>My local flavor of lint doesn’t seem to like the fact that I never <code>return</code>
from <code>main()</code>. Feh, what does it know? Otherwise, ignoring lint’s over
protectiveness (“Of course I’m not using all of the functions defined in
<code>curses.h</code>!”), it’s lint clean.</p>
<p>If the compiler happens to generate the byte sequence “AlWuzEre” in the
executable by chance, the program may be unable to locate the embedded string.
As a result, running the program without an external data file may act in
undefined ways.
If the compiler doesn’t store <code>char * P</code>’s data in a nice contiguous stream,
it would be bad. As above, it would break running the program without an
external data file.</p>
<p>If the incoming data is corrupt, the results are undefined. (Although dumping
core is a popular result.)</p>
<p>When a point passes behind the camera, it is still plotted. The object will
“bounce” off the camera, but the result (some points in front, some reflected
from the rear) looks really odd. And it sometimes hangs. So just don’t fly
through objects. You’ll be happier.</p>

<p>A point worth considering is that as the number passed into the program gets
bigger the number of lines of output gets substantially larger. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./schnitzi 9|wc -l
      771999</code></pre>
<p>The larger the number the bigger the file can become too, even becoming

something funny will happen, very possibly with different results per run. This

<p>The author gives an example command:</p>
<pre><code>    echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe | tr 876 tpo</code></pre>
<p>which should print out <code>poot</code> but it doesn’t, not in linux and not in macOS.</p>
<p>In linux it doesn’t crash but it doesn’t print anything out either.</p>
<p>In macOS it crashes; it might appear to not crash in macOS but this is because
of the pipeline. If you remove the <code>| tr 876 tpo</code> part of the command you will
see that it does indeed crash!</p>
<p>The reason for this not working is really strange.</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe
    7668
    $ echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe | grep 7
    $</code></pre>
<p>Why? Is it writing to stdout? Let’s try some other things:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo 7668 | tr 876 tpo
    poot</code></pre>
<p>Okay so we know that it SHOULD work. But we also know something funny is going on with stdout and the entry. Another experiment:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe 1&gt;&amp;2 | grep 7
    7668</code></pre>
<p>Okay so now it sees it, <code>grep</code>. But watch!</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe 2&gt;foo 1&gt;&amp;1
    7668
    $ cat foo</code></pre>
<p>.. so it does appear to be writing to stdout but yet somehow it doesn’t? But watch:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo &quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot; | ./dlowe 1&gt;foo 1&gt;&amp;1
    $ cat foo
    $</code></pre>
<p>Well this explains why the <code>tr</code> does not transliterate it to <code>poot</code> but why is
this happening? Why can’t it be redirected to another file even?</p>
<p>If it could be figured out why it’s not writing to stdout and yet at the same
time is writing to stdout one bug could be fixed. Maybe it’s the perl messing
with things but we don’t know.</p>
<p>Other commands do work, however, and give the appropriate output, such as:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo 1 2 + p | ./dlowe
    3</code></pre>
<p>so something is wrong with some commands/operators.</p>
<p>Another feature that does work in linux is:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo poot | ./dlowe
    poot was here!</code></pre>
<p>Can you help fix these problems?</p>
<p>Here is some C code that creates an unformatted perl script that will just
print ‘unimplemented’ for operators but it seems to work in some other ways (see
below for how to go further than unimplemented) which is the exact perl from the
C program except that it has the <code>#!/usr/bin/env perl</code> and <code>use warnings;</code> as
well. A note below might suggest that doing this creates incomplete perl.
Anyway:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main(void)
    {

<p>Compiling this you can generate:</p>
<pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/env perl

<p>Here is example input/output:</p>
<pre><code>    p
    stack empty
    5 p
    5
    5 + 5 p
    unimplemented
    5
    P
    5
    p
    5</code></pre>
<p>So you can see that if one uses operators it just shows ‘unimplemented’ (observe
how this does not happen in the C program in linux!) but if one uses ‘p’ by
itself it will print what’s on the stack (for example).</p>
<p>To not get ‘unimplemented’ you can remove from the perl:</p>
<pre><code>    sub AUTOLOAD { print&quot;unimplemented\n&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>(Note that the author stated this was used for exception handling so another
possibility is that the C code doesn’t generate the correct perl and indeed even
spaces is known to break the perl in at least one way, syntax errors, but maybe
others too.)</p>
<p>Here is an example run of several operations in the perl script after removing
that subroutine:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo 5 5 p | ./dlowe.pl
    5
    $ echo 5 5 + p | ./dlowe.pl
    5
    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::UU called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.
    $ echo 5 5 * p | ./dlowe.pl
    5
    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::ww called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.
    $ echo 5 5 - p | ./dlowe.pl
    5
    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::WW called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.
    $ echo 5 5 / p | ./dlowe.pl
    5
    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::YY called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.
    $ echo 5 P | ./dlowe.pl
    5$ echo p | ./dlowe.pl
    stack empty
    $ echo P | ./dlowe.pl
    stack empty</code></pre>
<p>Note the undefined subroutine error: that happens with commands that are not
even in the program. Again the author used <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for exception handling so
it seems likely that there is something missing (which the below shows as well).
For instance inputting <code>D</code> followed by <code>XX</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::nn called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 6.
    Undefined subroutine &amp;main::[[ called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.</code></pre>
<p>That means then that in linux despite the subroutines seemingly not existing it
works in the code, at least in some cases.</p>
<p>As far as the unimplemented error goes: the author stated that it means there is
invalid input. But as can be seen by the input given, the input is not
actually incorrect. It is also curious to note that it ends up printing what’s
on the stack at that point:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo 5 5 + p | ./dlowe.pl
    unimplemented
    5</code></pre>
<p>which might (?) suggest that the <code>+</code> operator is unimplemented.</p>

<p>The author states that in perl &lt; 5.6.0 there is a bug with a core dump in what
they said is in <code>Perl_sv_upgrade</code>. As this is documented it is not considered a
bug to be fixed. For the curious this will crash in macOS. It was noted that the
code that crashes is:</p>
<pre><code>    perl_eval_sv
    (newSVpv(&quot;_:$_=               &lt;&gt; ; defined               or exit; @ARGV&quot;

    &quot;)} sub __{print            \&quot;stack empty\\&quot;            &quot;n\&quot;} sub ss{$#&quot;
    &quot;SS&lt;0 and goto &amp;            __; print $SS[$&quot;            &quot;#SS].\&quot;\\n\&quot;} &quot;
    &quot;sub SS{ $#SS&lt;0              and goto &amp;__ ;              print pop @SS}&quot;
    &quot;sub _ { print              \&quot;divide by zer&quot;            &quot;o\\n\&quot;}sub ii{&quot;

    &quot;=$SS[$#SS-1]}                   &quot;,0),0                   );</code></pre>
<p>and in particular it appears that it is the perl itself. In other words if one
changes it to be:</p>
<pre><code>    perl_eval_sv(newSVpv(&quot;&quot;,0),0);</code></pre>
<p>it will not crash. But of course it won’t do anything either. So it’s more
specifically that the call to <code>newSVpv()</code> crashes the code but <em>INSIDE</em>
(key point!) the call to <code>perl_eval_sv()</code> that does it. Given what the author
stated and that the version of perl is &lt; than 5.6.0 which the author states can
crash this makes sense.</p>
<p>The example command above <em>should</em> print:</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo &quot;13 14 15 16 17 + - * / p&quot; | ./dlowe
    -0.0515873015873016</code></pre>
<p>and that’s what it shows in linux.</p>
<p>Note that with different perl libraries in macOS (for instance from
<a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> and <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> package managers) it will
likely print different warnings when compiling. It was observed that with
Homebrew it does not report any warnings but with MacPorts it results in a total
of 92 warnings! Nonetheless neither works okay and both crash.</p>

<p>This was fixed so that it doesn’t segfault and then also fixed the functionality
of it (but see below).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2001/anonymous/anonymous.ten.c">anonymous.ten.c</a> program was
also fixed (it also segfaulted) but note that it <strong>MUST</strong> be compiled as a <strong>32-bit ELF
binary</strong> so it will NOT work in macOS (for example); if you cannot use <code>-m32</code> or
even if you can but it cannot compile as an ELF binary (not elf binary :-) )
(but see below) then the <code>anonymous</code> program itself will very likely crash if
you run it on the compiled
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2001/anonymous/anonymous.ten.c">anonymous.ten.c</a>; if nothing else
it will not modify the target executable (this part of the fix at least should
be correct).</p>
<p>Note also that if you don’t specify a file or you specify a non-32-bit ELF file
this program will very likely crash or do something strange like slaughter the

<p>The author stated that it only works with i386 linux so the fact it doesn’t work
in modern systems is considered a feature and not a bug.</p>
<p>An initial segfault was fixed (trying to open the file) and the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2001/bellard/bellard.otccex.c">supplementary
program bellard.otccex.c</a> was also
fixed but this still crashes in systems not i386 linux which is what the author
stated.</p>
<p>The author said that they compiled it with <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.95.2/gcc-everything-2.95.2.tar.gz">gcc version
2.95.2</a>. We
don’t know if a certain gcc version is necessary but it might be helpful to
download and compile that version to test it - or it might not.</p>
<p>Yusuke was able to get this to work with <code>-m32</code> but only in an emulator. As
such, it might be that the changes made should be rolled back but at least now
the supplementary program will work in modern systems.</p>
<p>On the author’s <a href="https://bellard.org/otcc/">web page for this program</a> it is
explicitly stated that it requires i386 linux.</p>
<p>There it was found what should be a more portable version which is included as
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2001/bellard/otccelf.c">otccelf.c</a> (after adding some <code>#include</code>s
and the modification but it appears this <em>also</em> requires i386 linux; indeed
looking at the code it hard codes paths that are i386 specific to linux.</p>
<p>Another point of interest is that the author provided unobfuscated versions
which might be of value to look at.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<h4 id="aside-why-were-there-changes-made-if-inabiaf">Aside: why were there changes made if INABIAF ?</h4>
<p>This is a good question. The reason is we believe it better to fix some obvious
problems: there were some bugs that would very possibly prevent it from working
even if it was in i386 linux though it did seem to work in an emulator, so
perhaps not. Still it’s better to have the type of the file pointer correct and
so that the file can at least be opened in modern systems even if the compiler
won’t work there.</p>
<p>Also the supplementary program, which did not work at all, was fixed and it can
be run by itself for fun in modern systems, which was not possible before the
fixes there.</p>

end.</p>
<p>The author also noted that some versions of <code>curses</code> have problems with
<code>getch()</code> having a delay.</p>
<p>The program is very likely to segfault if the specified port can’t be bound or
connected to.</p>
<p>If the terminal is too wide (the author suggests over 500 characters) the
program can segfault.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to crash the program if a player scores over a billion
points.</p>
<p>Although it is independent of endianness both systems need the same character

<p>This function uses <code>gets(3)</code> but it would be ideal if it used <code>fgets(3)</code>. This
one is rather complicated but you are welcome to try and fix this if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="status-main-has-only-one-arg---try-and-make-it-have-2-or-3">STATUS: main() has only one arg - try and make it have 2 or 3</h3>
<p>This program only has one arg to <code>main()</code>. However changing it to have 2 is not
as simple as it might seem. Doing this breaks things. If memory serves changing
it to two will, for instance, break the punch card code output. It might be that
that is for <code>fgets(3)</code>, however, but the point remains: in order to test any
fixes you must determine if the extra files generated (some from <code>sort(1)</code>) -
see the index.html file - generate correct output as well as that the main entry
does too. You might try running the <code>try.sh</code> script and redirect it to a file
first so that you can compare the output. Make sure to recreate the extra files
as described by the author if you do fix this. This might be looked at later if
nobody else takes up the challenge.</p>

<p>There seem to be a couple bugs at least in this entry. The first one is that
when it does reach a certain point it crashes. This is in the function <code>J()</code> (or
one it calls?). But sometimes it seems to not get that far, just showing lines
moving back and forth. This is also in <code>J()</code>. It is not confirmed but it might
be that the lines are drawn by <code>XDrawString()</code>, the last part in <code>J()</code>.</p>
<p><code>J()</code> has a <code>for</code> loop identified by <code>for</code> and also a couple <code>while</code> loops,
identified by <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Since the game never ends properly the score is not printed either.</p>
<p>It appears that the crash happens in more than one place. For instance it has
happened at</p>
<pre><code>    XCheckMaskEvent(d, 4,&amp;e)</code></pre>
<p>but it’s also happened at</p>
<pre><code>    else XDrawPoint(d    ,w,g,(l.s+=l.a)&gt;&gt;9,    h=(l.c+=l.b)&gt;&gt;9)</code></pre>
<p>In both cases the pointer <code>d</code> was corrupted:</p>
<pre><code>    (lldb) p d
    (Display *) 0x0000000000000001</code></pre>
<p>It is believed that it also happened at</p>
<pre><code>    XDrawString(d,w,g,W/3,H/2,m,B);</code></pre>
<p>in <code>J()</code> and for the same reason.</p>
<p>The loop seems to be stuck in the call to <code>usleep(3)</code> like:</p>
<pre><code>    usleep(p*200);</code></pre>
<p>which happens to be in a <code>while()</code> loop.</p>
<p>There is a way to get the code to crash. If you don’t do anything until
everything is destroyed (where you’d lose the game if it ended) and then you
start to shoot your missiles repeatedly it will eventually crash. It appears not
to be the case (though this was not tried as many times) if you start shooting
when the missiles come down. The fact you can shoot after it starts that
sleeping in a loop does suggest that it’s not stuck only showing those lines and
sleeping.</p>

<p>This program is x86 linux specific; it is extremely likely that a segmentation
fault will occur in other systems but even if it does not it is highly unlikely
it will work. Below we will give some examples as well as a change that was made
to let it compile with clang.</p>
<p>In macOS with the arm64 chip this will segfault:</p>
<pre><code>    ./gavin &gt; kernel</code></pre>
<p>When trying to link <code>gavin.o</code> to produce <code>sh</code>, the linker generates:</p>
<pre><code>    Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
      &quot;start&quot;, referenced from:

<p>The author stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguments matching <code>/[^2]22$/</code> cause the program to segfault after rapidly
exhausting the available stack space. I could probably fix this by adding some
special cases to the code, but [Blaine the Mono] it’s quite a bit more exciting
this way, don’t you think?[/Blaine] Since the trailing <code>22</code> will be its own
atom anyway, you can just insert a space in front of it if you run into this
feature (e.g. <code>1 22</code> instead of <code>122</code>).</p>
<p>Arguments matching <code>/(?:.){10,}/</code> will produce visually incorrect results
(e.g., generation 1 starting from 1111111111 will print as <code>: 1</code>), but there’s
nothing interesting about these arguments that can’t be modeled using shorter
runs of the same symbol.</p>
<p>Arguments matching <code>/(?:.){257,}/</code> may produce mathematically incorrect
results (e.g., generation 1 starting from a string of 257 <code>1</code>s will be
calculated as <code>11</code>); the remark from the previous paragraph applies here also.</p>

<p>This program sometimes will create unsolvable puzzles :-) just to hook you.
As a protection against this - and to prevent you from spending too much time on
such puzzles (or too big puzzles if you insist on doing this) - it deliberately
destroys its runtime stack. See the <a href="2005/anon/index.html">index.html</a> for more
details on this.</p>
<p>If you specify more than three args the program might also crash or do something
strange. This might also happen if you specify excessively large board
dimensions. Try <code>100 100 100</code> for instance and see what happens!</p>

<p>The author states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only built-in functions are <code>defvar</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>substitute</code>,
<code>char-upcase</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>.<br></p>
<p>Only one variable is available. This variable is called <code>q</code>, although any
symbol name starting with the letter <code>q</code> will be mapped to this variable.<br></p>
<p>Only the first letter of a function name is significant. For example,
<code>format</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>farm</code>, and various other words starting with <code>f</code> will all map to
the <code>format</code> function.<br></p>
<p>The <code>defvar</code> function completely ignores its first parameter. It will always
store the result of evaluating its second parameter in <code>q</code>. Unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a>, multiple invocations of
<code>defvar</code> on the same variable will overwrite old values.<br></p>
<p>Character constants are limited to <code>#\Newline</code> and single-character constants
such as <code>#\x</code>.<br></p>
<p>The <code>char-upcase</code> function will give strange results if passed something other
than a lowercase character.<br></p>
<p>The <code>format</code> function takes exactly three parameters. The first parameter is
ignored; output always goes to <code>stdout</code>. The second parameter must have exactly
one <code>~s</code> format specifier in it, and no other format specifiers are
permitted.<br></p>
<p>The arithmetic functions take exactly two parameters.<br></p>
<p>All tokens must be separated from a following <code>)</code> by whitespace.<br></p>
<p>A lot of other things. Notably, the language which this program interprets is
nowhere near
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a>.<br></p>
<p>Basically, the LISP interpreter is good for some basic math operations, and
for running itself.</p>

<p>Probably this is obvious, but this entry will not work with https. An
alt version exists that <em>SCANS</em> for https in case someone wants to set up a pipeline or
other workaround (perhaps with <code>stunnel</code>) or even add additional code to it to
make it work with https but the problem otherwise is a secure connection has to
first be set up in order to give http commands. This is not a bug but it’s worth
pointing out as it won’t work on as many websites as it used to including the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC website</a> itself. The author noted that someone did
make a version that supports <code>https</code> but it is not known where this might be.</p>

<p>The machine emulated is an older 40 column one so 80 column programs will not

<p>There is no emulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET</a>

<p>The parameter controls the speed of the 60Hz “jiffy clock”, and not the

it really depends on the speed of your machine.</p>
<p>Although the PET <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulator</a> can do <code>LOAD</code>

but you are welcome to try and fix it.</p>

<p>The author stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you pick a number higher than 19186, the program will return a solution but
it will be a rotation of one of the first 19186. This is because the cross
shaped piece fits 48 ways in the 4x4 cube, but only 2 of those ways are unique -
you can rotate one of those to make any of the other 46. The algorithm used
always places the cross piece first, so the first two placings of that piece
result in the 19186 unique solutions.</p>
<p>If you pick a number higher than 460464 (24x19186) the program will return
without outputting a solution. If you can wait that long.</p>

<p>This was fixed to
not crash in macOS (it appeared to work fine in fedora linux on an <code>x86_64</code>
architecture but it is not known if it crashed in macOS Ventura due to the fact
it is an <code>arm64</code> CPU - the Apple silicon chip, but given that the author later
made some slight changes to make it not crash in <code>x86_64</code> macOS that might be
the case).</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are two features that are not bugs.</p>
<p>By design this program is supposed to crash on termination. This actually no
longer seems to happen but we don’t need this to be added even if it might
be called a bug :-)</p>
<p>You must type in caps (except in strings) and this program is indeed
case-sensitive.</p>

<p>This does not appear to work with macOS, resulting in a segfault (and sometimes
a bus error).</p>
<p>We’re not sure if this is to do with the Apple silicon chip or not but it seems
like it <em>might</em> (see Apple resources below) be but it could also be a wider
problem with macOS. It appears that Apple does not allow certain combinations of
memory protections with the arm64 processor.</p>
<p>Some of the workarounds have been tried but at this time it did not seem to
work. Some earlier debugging sessions are below as well as a resource from the
author as well as some resources on Apple’s website should anyone wish to take a
crack at it. A starting point might be in
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2011/richards/richards.alt.c">richards.alt.c</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance it appeared to be that it might be the function pointers or the
fact it is trying to execute code in memory (as noted above). The function
pointers were changed a bit but this has not helped solve the problem with
macOS. A few things that were noticed depending on <code>asan</code> sanitisers specified.
With <code>address</code> in linux:</p>
<pre><code>    richards.c:101:9: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null</code></pre>
<p>but it actually works. This code is:</p>
<pre><code>    } else
                p++;
        W(c)} /* LINE 101 */
    }</code></pre>
<p>Okay but what about argument 2? Well <code>W</code> is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>    #define W(c) e=memmove(e,x[(u)c], y[(u)c])+y[(u)c];</code></pre>
<p>so it would appear that</p>
<pre><code>    x[(u)c]</code></pre>
<p>is NULL. But why does it work then?</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>u</code> is <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>Under macOS (with the arm64 chip) we get:</p>

A curious thing is in the <code>mprotect()</code> function: <code>#if CONFIG_DYNAMIC_CODE_SIGNING</code> and the protection variable has the

<p>The author stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The memory locations of <code>argv</code> are used for various purposes. Therefore, the
program name (default <code>deckmyn</code>) must be <em>at least 4 characters long</em>, including
possibly the path. This, along with the ending <code>'\0'</code>, gives a minimum 5 bytes
of useful memory space. Otherwise, the program may attempt to write outside the
string.</p>
<p>The code is quite sensitive. Errors in the input can lead to strange
results. The code does not read beyond the end of the music input, but that is
about the only error checking available. Any input that is not according to the
rules in the deckmyn.html, may cause errors.</p>
<p>The program has no special hardware limitations or requirements, other than
8bit <code>char</code> (<code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>) and two’s complement negatives.</p>
<p>The limitations of using <code>char</code> as counters for e.g. the number of music
staves are minor. 127 staves to a page is rather a lot.</p>
<p>The file layout must be exactly the same as deckmyn.c though, only the
locations of space (<code>" "</code>) may differ.</p>
<p>Every element in the music is given by a string of <em>exactly</em> 3 characters.
Any violation of this will result in the rest of the music being interpreted in
some randomly wrong way. Notice that in a file, the newline is also a character!
Therefore, when preparing music in a file, care should be taken that the last
musical element of a line is only 2 characters!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the input doesn’t start with a valid program, that is, if the interpreter
reaches end-of-file during program parsing, it will crash in some way. E.g. the
following might dump core:</p>
<p><code>echo -n "U" | ./tromp</code></p>
<p>Furthermore, the interpreter requires the initial encoded lambda term to be
closed, that is, variable n can only appear within at least ‘n’ enclosing
lambdas. For instance, here the term <code>'\ 5'</code> is not closed, causing the
interpreter to crash when looking into a null-pointer environment:</p>
<p><code>echo "&gt;Hello, world" | ./tromp</code></p>
<p>will likely dump core.</p>

<ul>
<li>The width of input images must be a multiple of 4.</li>
<li>Input images can be 8-bit greyscale, 24-bit color or 32-bit color only. 8-bit
color and 16-bit color are not supported. If you use the “color” command-line
feature, do not use a greyscale input file!</li>
<li>Normal Windows BMP files are stored “upside-down”, i.e. the bottom line in the
image is written first. Some (old) graphics programs actually write BMP files
“top-to-bottom” and the program does not support such files.</li>
<li>Using anti-aliased brush strokes to draw your letters is fine; however,
antialiasing interferes with color detection in “color” mode.</li>
<li>Only runs on little endian machines (since the BMP format is little endian,
and endianness conversion would make the source too large for IOCCC rule 2).</li>

<p>This program will possibly crash or draw something strange with 0 args. Then
again it might not. :-) This is easy to fix but would add bytes and since the
author noted it is a feature and not a bug. You of course can try and fix it
yourself but please do NOT open a pull request for this: just do it as an
exercise to see if you understand the code.</p>
<p>You can try and answer the questions, too: when will it crash? When will it draw
something funny (or will it? :-) ) and when will it just do nothing?</p>
<p>The author also stated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produces bogus graphs when given &gt; about 5000 arguments.</li>
<li>Only works if your terminal is UTF-8 and your font supports the 8 glyphs
used.</li>

<p>The author reminds us that if you kill the program you will have to wait a short
bit of time before you can start it again if you want it to be able to bind to
the socket (which obviously you do). The source is out the scope of this
document but the author does mention the well known (at least to those of us who
have experience with socket programming :-) ) fix. However as the author pointed
it out as a known limitation it is not a bug but a feature.</p>

<p>The author noted that in macOS the colours might be wrong and gives a solution,
though it is unclear if this is still true or if there was any problem at all.</p>
<p>The author noted that the character cannot go through walls and the impression
is that this is how it was believed but someone did ironically point out that
there are known glitches where in some places you actually could go through
walls. This might even have applied to the arcade version, Mario Bros, though
that can no longer be confirmed by said person. The point here is that in this
game you cannot go through walls but it’s not a bug.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the author also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <code>Super character</code> becomes bigger (<code>ZOOM</code> flag), the character can
collide with blocks and get stuck inside them. This is a KNOWN BUG. When your
player become bigger, stay away from blocks!</p>

<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> discovered a bug to do
with translating sound to text that shows itself in some cases (it works in
others) when working on his winning <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/blob/master/2020/ferguson2/prog.c">2020 Enigma machine</a>
(‘Most enigmatic’) entry. See his <a href="2020/ferguson2/index.html">index.html</a> for
details (search for <code>vik</code> in the file). This one might be more of a limitation
but this is not known.</p>
<p>He provides a tip in testing the problem: it might help to use his Enigma
machine to find problems as it will allow you to verify what is correct and what
is not. Again see his index.html for details. However it is also possible to not
rely on the entry as the below shows. One should be able to do:</p>
<pre><code>    echo &#39;No. I want chocolate!&#39; | ./prog &gt; chocolate.raw

    ./prog e &lt; chocolate.raw</code></pre>
<p>and get:</p>
<pre><code>    No. I want some chocolate!</code></pre>
<p>but instead we get:</p>
<pre><code>    IT FHOCOLITE!</code></pre>
<p>which is very wrong. If however one does:</p>
<pre><code>    echo IOCCC | ./prog &gt; ioccc.raw

    ./prog e &lt; ioccc.raw</code></pre>
<p>they will properly get:</p>
<pre><code>    IOCCC</code></pre>

<p>Hard requirements:</p>
<p>The platform must implement the <code>double</code> type as IEEE754-compliant 64-bit
floating point numbers. The 80-bit intermediate format used by x87 is
considered as an violation of this. The code should print an error message on
such platforms.</p>
<p>The program must start with the CPU / FPU in round-to-nearest mode.</p>
<p>Soft requirements:</p>
<p>The compiler must respect <code>volatile</code>. The code is formatted to warn about
that, though.</p>
<p>The printed result is only correct on little-endian machines. The program
takes care to warn about this issue after printing an incorrect big-endian
result. Error messages become garbled, though.</p>

<p>The test scripts do not seem to work properly with bash but this would be ideal
as not all systems have a compatible shell (they assume a POSIX compliant

uncertain if it should be.</p>
<p>The author also stated:</p>

<p>While the program works best when bytes/characters are octets and the number
of bits in a type is <code>sizeof(typ) &lt;&lt; 3</code>, it will work correctly on 24-bit or
36-bit systems with 9 bits/byte, or systems where <code>sizeof(typ)</code> is 1 even for

crash and halt. If this is the case type ctrl-e to quit the emulator and try
again.</p>
<p>The author also stated that it is possible to corrupt the virtual disk. If you
do this you should type <code>make clobber all</code> and try again.</p>
<p>A funny problem where it showed <code>ERROR</code> after each command was noticed. The
solution was to hit ctrl-e and start again. It is not known if this is what was

<p>Another issue noticed is that if you are using the saved mode you must type

<p>The author wrote the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite appearances, it does not handle numbers in hex, or provide
a <code>curses(3)</code>-based interface.</p></li>
<li><p>The expected input format is zero or more lines of space-separated
integers. If other characters appear in the input, it will either
reject the input entirely and exit with a non-zero status, or skip
number(s) adjacent to the non-digit characters, depending on where the
characters appear. Tabs and multiple consecutive spaces are handled
correctly, however.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual lines of input longer than <code>0x3543 - 1</code> bytes will be
split and processed as if they were multiple lines of input, which can
produce incorrect results. This magic number’s significance is
described earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The algorithm expects its input to represent a fully connected graph.
While the output is otherwise topologically sorted, if there are nodes
completely unconnected to the rest of the graph (with or without
self-cycles), they will be output as soon as they are processed –
this means that, when there are disconnected nodes, reordering the
input lines can produce different output. Addressing this by adding
another pass is would put the program over the size limit.</p></li>
<li><p>While the node IDs don’t need to be consecutive or start at 0, the
implementation doesn’t have special handling for sparse graphs. If you
give it a graph with nodes numbered 0 and 2147483647, it will attempt
to allocate sufficient memory (potentially around 32 GB) for the
entire range of graph nodes, even if those are the only ones. If
memory allocation returns NULL, it will gracefully exit, otherwise it
will succeed, eventually, perhaps after a great deal of swapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Node IDs &gt;= 2147483648 will cause the program to print an error
message and exit with a non-zero status. This shrinks the code that
detects overflowing the array size by a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>A very large group of nodes in a cycle can cause a stack overflow.
This typically takes over 100,000 nodes, and depends on the order the
nodes are visited. Addressing this would put the program over the size
limit.</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation depends on the characters <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, … <code>'9'</code> having
the values <code>48</code> through <code>57</code>, rather than using <code>isdigit(3)</code>. As noted above,
this program has nothing to do with a hand.</p></li>

<p>The scripts were fixed so that they can work but it might end up that the
scripts don’t show any output anyway as they use the full alphabet. To test that
it works one can have a script like:</p>
<pre><code>    LC_ALL=C  aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz | LC_ALL=C grep .. | LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8 ./prog aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz</code></pre>
<p>If you run this you should see:</p>
<pre><code>    aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz</code></pre>
<p>which shows it works. However as the de.sh script refers to all letters it can’t
find a perfect pangram. BTW, as far as the question of whether the umlaut
letters or the Eszett are considered letters in the German alphabet, it is
noted in the de.sh/de.alt.sh scripts:</p>
<pre><code>    # Are the umlauts ä, ö, ü and Eszett (ß) letters in the German alphabet? There
    # is more than one opinion on the subject but a lot of words do have an umlaut
    # (or Umlaut in German). In some (probably all) systems this script outputs
    # nothing probably because it&#39;s very hard to form a perfect pangram in German,
    # if it&#39;s not impossible. Nevertheless, we do include the other characters
    # whether or not they are in your view considered part of the alphabet for the
    # reason that so many words have them.</code></pre>

<p>This is NOT a bug and you’ll have to delete the files
manually. You shouldn’t have to worry about these being added to git: it seems
to ignore sockets (it did at least in macOS).</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<p>Tips on this situation. A simpler way to find sockets in the directory:</p>
<pre><code>    file .*|grep socket|cut -f1 -d:</code></pre>
<p>To delete them you can do:</p>
<pre><code>    find . -exec file &#39;{}&#39; \;|grep socket|cut -f 1 -d: | xargs rm -f</code></pre>
<p>though one might want to check that the program is not currently running. :-)</p>

<p>The author stated the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program must be ran in a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes for
moving the cursor and changing colors.</li>
<li>Segfaults happen sometimes.</li>
<li>I don’t know what memory management there is, if any.</li>
<li>The program will not compile by an ANSI C compiler: it uses for loops, and it
uses C++ style comments. It should compile cleanly using a C99 standard.</li>
<li>Breadth first search is slow (and very slow on certain maps), but my A star
version of this program is too big.</li>
<li>Lots of extra whitespace may be needed if you want to feed in an arbitrary
file.</li>
<li>It fails to compile on GCC sometimes (according to a friend of mine, I’ve not
encountered this myself).</li>
<li>The program could be obfuscated much further.</li>
<li>The program contains some unused code and data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: the segfault problem might have been fixed when the optimiser was disabled
(which was necessary as part of a bug fix).</p>

<p>The author wrote that if you decide to change networks or use a different input
file you should delete all the checkpoint files because the format depends on
both the network and the input – using the wrong checkpoint is likely to cause
a crash.</p>
<p>The author also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Since OMLET uses the system stack for network storage, larger
networks may cause OMLET to crash (typically with a message like Segmentation
fault) unless the system stack size is first increased. The exact command for
doing so depends on your shell and your system’s hard limits. On sh/ksh/bash
shells, you can view the hard limit with ulimit -Hs and set it with ulimit -s
65532 (replacing 65532 with the actual hard limit). On csh/tcsh shells, you can
view the hard limit with limit -h stacksize and set it with limit stacksize
65532 (replacing 65532 with the actual hard limit).</p>

<p>The author noted that if the program runs out of memory it is likely to crash.</p>
<p>The author also stated that ‘if input contains CR-LF end of line sequences,
those <code>CR</code>s are silently dropped. In fact, most control codes are silently
ignored except line feeds (preserved) and tabs (expanded to 8 spaces).’</p>

<p>The author stated that bad things happen if the entered move is outside of the
range [1..9]. We observed a crash but we also observed a tie and other things
besides (say with the input <code>-1</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>-10</code> and others).</p>
<p>If a player makes a move over their opponent’s place they will automatically
lose.</p>
<p>If a player tries to play a move they already played they will forfeit their
move.</p>
<p>If you have audible bells enabled the program will beep at every turn.</p>

<p>The author listed the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The program does not support MIDI files over 4 MB (specifically, it will
not take input files larger than <code>2^22 - 1</code> bytes). This is unlikely to be a
big limitation in practice, since even lengthy MIDIs are rarely over a
couple hundred KB.</p></li>
<li><p>Not all MIDIs set (or <em>correctly</em> set) their timing information, which will
lead to the tempo of the drum beat not matching the track. This will be
especially true for “live performance” .mid files.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be some types of MIDI messages that the program is unable to
correctly parse, but I have rarely seen this in practice. The largest
cause of program failures, in my experience, has been Limitation 2.</p></li>
