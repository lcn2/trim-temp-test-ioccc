<h1 id="bugs-and-misfeatures">Bugs and (Mis)features</h1>
<p>There are a number of known problems with IOCCC entries: many of
which have to do with differences between today’s compiler environments
and those of today. In some cases the original code has a bug, some
of which were recently discovered and many of which were fixed. In some cases
attempt to port older code to more modern environments introduced bugs.</p>
<p>The following is a known list of <strong>BUGS and (mis)FEATURES</strong> in IOCCC entries.</p>
<p>Can you fix/improve entries not under the INABIAF (it’s not a bug it’s a
feature)? You are <strong>VERY WELCOME</strong> to try.</p>
<p>As far as how to help: please submit your fixes in a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> (with ONE PULL
REQUEST <em>PER</em> FIX, please)!</p>
<p>We will be <strong>happy to credit anyone who submits successful <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
requests</a></strong> in the
<a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a> file. If you’re the author of an entry
that win the IOCCC, we will add a link to your winning entries in the file
(if you’re not an author, we can add a link to your GitHub page or personal
website if you have one, should you wish).</p>
<p>If you do fix an entry please feel free to delete the entry from this file!
Otherwise if you wish to not worry about it we can do that to make sure the
format is consistent and clean.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>
<h2 id="to-the-winning-authors">To the winning authors:</h2>
<p>If you’re the author of an entry that has been fixed and you find it against
your liking <strong>PLEASE</strong> let us know and we’ll be happy to undo any fixes even if
it takes away some instructional value or even usability. _In this case we’re
<strong>VERY SORRY</strong> about it: it’s a fine line, we know, and we tried to use careful
judgement but invariably some might have been the wrong decision. Thank you for
understanding!</p>
<p>I (<a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a>)
accept the blame in some cases; when working on getting entries to compile
sometimes I got carried away with it and there might be that I fixed some things
that should not have been fixed. I am correcting these mistakes as I come across
them but if I miss any please let the judges or me know.</p>
<h3 id="on-all-fixes-improvements-changes">ON <strong>ALL</strong> FIXES / IMPROVEMENTS / CHANGES</h3>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you test the entry <em>BEFORE</em> <strong>AND</strong> <em>AFTER</em> your
changes! This includes output and the same input functionality! Sometimes it
might seem to be fine but is actually not! We will note some where this is known
to happen (if it’s not yet fixed). This has actually already happened to us.
Sometimes it is okay: some entries are known to not work but they can still have
improvements (rarer situation but it’s happened). Some might have slightly
different output but which is not a problem for instance a newline after output
in <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a>’s changing it to
<a href="1994/ldb/ldb.c">1994/ldb</a> use <code>fgets()</code> from <code>gets()</code>.</p>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you read the index.html file <em>BEFORE</em> your changes
as it’s important to see that the code is doing what it is supposed to. In the
case that it’s not obvious (some index.html files do not even have commands to
try or even explain how to use it!) then you should either skip the entry OR ask
someone who will know e.g. us.</p>
<p>Make <strong>ABSOLUTE CERTAIN</strong> that you read the next section, the list of statuses
and the related information, BEFORE you submit a pull request!</p>
<p><strong>BE VERY AWARE</strong> that sometimes fixing an entry for one platform will break it
under another so if you have more than one platform (e.g. macOS and linux) it
would be wise to test it under all that you have access to. Otherwise we can do
that. Of course if the entry does not work under any platform and you fix it for
one that’s more than fine (and it has been done numerous times).</p>
<p>Again, THANK YOU!</p>
<h1 id="list-of-statuses---please-read-before-fixing-you-may-skip-if-youre-only-interested-in-knowing-about-entries-with-known-issues">LIST OF STATUSES - PLEASE READ BEFORE FIXING (you may skip if you’re only interested in knowing about entries with known issues)</h1>
<p>Entries below have one or more of the following <em><strong>STATUS</strong></em> values. Please see
the text below for more information. If an entry has more than one status it
means that either they all apply or they compliment each other. For instance
<a href="2004/gavin/gavin.c">2004/gavin</a> crashes but it also doesn’t even compile with
some platforms/architectures.</p>
<h2 id="general-notes-about-the-statuses-and-making-fixes">General notes about the statuses and making fixes</h2>
<h3 id="compiler-warnings-are-very-rarely-a-problem">Compiler warnings are very rarely a problem</h3>
<p>In general warnings should NOT be addressed. The only time they should be
CONSIDERED is when the entry does not work. However note that sometimes trying
to fix the warnings will actually introduce bugs! Other times ‘fixing’ them will
break the entry (see below).</p>
<p>Below in some entries we do list some warnings that definitely should be ignored
(including some introduced by fixes) but we do not list them all: trying to keep
track of them all would be impractical especially as different compilers give
different warnings.</p>
<p>Another type of warning that would be hard to keep track of is different data
sizes on different platforms. These tend to be required at the risk that
sometimes the entry will not work for certain platforms, some of which might or
might not be fixable; a good example where it was required to change and is okay
is when <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed the
segfault in macOS of <a href="1994/paul/paul.c">1989/paul</a>: changing the <code>int *</code> to a
<code>long *</code> was required and it works just as well with linux.</p>
<p>But even if they are fixable (which will likely be hard to do) it’s almost
certain that such code would be just as non-portable (importable ? :-) ).</p>
<p>In rare cases they are valid. For instance Cody noticed in linux the following
warning in <a href="1985/applin/applin.c">1985/applin</a> with gcc:</p>
<pre><code>applin.c:1:78: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function &#39;execlp&#39; [-Wbuiltin-declaration-mismatch]
    1 | main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]=strdup(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);(!!c)[*c]&amp;&amp;(v--||--c&amp;&amp;execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));**c=!c)write(!!*c,*c,!!**c);}
      |                                                                              ^~~~~~</code></pre>
<p>and this reminded him of his fix to
<a href="1984/anonymous/anonymous.c">1984/anonymous</a>. In the case of <code>1984/anonymous</code> it
was a bit more involved but with <code>1985/applin</code> one need only add to the Makefile
<code>-include unistd.h</code>. So there are some cases where fixing warnings can fix a
problem but in general they should be ignored even if they’re annoying.</p>
<p>Hopefully with the example entries listed above you get the idea.</p>
<h3 id="general-request-on-original-code">General request on original code:</h3>
<p>If you’re fixing an entry please make as <em>FEW CHANGES AS POSSIBLE</em>! This is to
make it as close to the original but allowing it to work. This might be less of
a problem when providing alternate versions but it might still be nice to have
it as close as possible to the original. See also below two points.</p>
<h3 id="request-for-one-liners">Request for one-liners:</h3>
<p>For one-liners <em>PLEASE KEEP THE FILE ONE LINE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE</em>! If it needs an
include you can update the Makefile <code>CINCLUDE</code> variable. For instance if it
needs <code>stdio.h</code> you could do <code>-include stdio.h</code>. Please leave a space after the
<code>=</code> in the Makefile. You may also have extra long lines if this seems useful to
make it a one-liner even if it kind of makes it longer than what the judges
consider a one-liner. Thank you!</p>
<h3 id="on-layout-of-program-source">On layout of program source:</h3>
<p>If you make changes <em>PLEASE TRY AND KEEP THE SOURCE CODE LAYOUT AS CLOSE TO THE
ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE</em>. This might not always be possible and if you have an
editor that does formatting it can cause problems. Sometimes formatters can even
break code! <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> has
experienced this many times with vim so he tends to disable all format options
when formatting code. In vim you should be able to do that with:</p>
<pre><code>:set formatoptions=</code></pre>
<h2 id="status-known-bug---please-help-us-fix">STATUS: known bug - please help us fix</h2>
<p>Entries with this status have one or more bugs that need to be fixed. Are you
able to fix it? We welcome your help!</p>
<p>An important point to note is that there is a very fine line when fixing bugs
where it might sometimes border on tampering with the program. And after all,
these are not meant to be maintainable or even good programming style! Use
careful judgement when fixing bugs please!</p>
<h2 id="status-possible-bug-possibly-depending-on-system---please-help-test-and-if-necessary-fix">STATUS: possible bug (possibly depending on system) - please help test and if necessary fix</h2>
<p>Entries with this status might or might not have a bug possibly depending on the
system. In these entries it’s unknown if there is a bug and sometimes it’s
because we do not remember and sometimes we don’t have the appropriate system or
environment to test and fix any possible problems.</p>
<h2 id="status-might-not-be-completely-functional---can-you-confirm">STATUS: might not be completely functional - can you confirm?</h2>
<p>Although these entries <em>appear</em> to work for one or more reasons we’re unsure if
they are completely functional. Can you confirm this? Please let us know so we
can fix it!</p>
<h2 id="status-probable-bug-possibly-depending-on-system---please-help-test-and-if-necessary-fix">STATUS: probable bug (possibly depending on system) - please help test and if necessary fix</h2>
<p>Entries with this status almost certainly have a bug or some other problem. The
issue or issues might depend on the system much like the above <em>STATUS: possible
bug (possibly depending on system)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="status-doesnt-work-with-some-platforms---please-help-us-fix">STATUS: doesn’t work with some platforms - please help us fix</h2>
<p>Entries with this status do not work under some OSes and/or architectures (and/or
something else?). Please help us to fix it!</p>
<h2 id="status-doesnt-work-with-some-compilers---please-provide-alternative-code-or-fix-for-more-compilers">STATUS: doesn’t work with some compilers - please provide alternative code or fix for more compilers</h2>
<p>Some entries do not work with some compilers. A good example is
<a href="1992/lush/lush.c">1992/lush</a> which uses error messages from the compiler to
generate its output.</p>
<p>If you can provide code that works for multiple compilers without too much
tampering this is okay though it’s probably not possible with the above
mentioned entry; otherwise it would be better to provide alternate code. In some
cases it might be better to provide alternate code anyway. Use a judgement call
here as best you can manage.</p>
<h2 id="status-main-function-args-not-allowed---please-help-us-fix">STATUS: main() function args not allowed - please help us fix</h2>
<p>NOTE: it appears that most if not all of these have been fixed except perhaps
for <a href="1989/westley/westley.c">1989/westley</a> but this has probably been fixed as
much as possible given the nature of how it generates code: the entry itself
compiles but two versions of code it generates does not work with clang.</p>
<p>However some still might have problems of some kind or another and some might
not yet be located as an additional defect of clang was noticed where <code>main()</code>
is not allowed four args or one arg.</p>
<p>This is what the status means, however.</p>
<p>Entries with this status have a problem in that the args to main() are not of a
specific type or there are too many due to this being allowed in earlier C. Some
compilers like clang have a defect where they do not allow this and some
versions have an additional defect where they only allow 0, 2 or 3 args, the
latter of which affected <code>1989/westley</code>, so these entries do not work with
clang.</p>
<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> looked at the source
code of clang and reported that there is no way to override the requirement of
arg types so these entries will fail to compile with clang. That’s why in some
entries he fixed he did it by adding a function called <code>pain()</code>. :-) He did not
check for the number of args as that was discovered later but he suspects it’s
the same issue.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE for macOS users</strong>: please be aware that <em>gcc</em> under macOS <strong>is actually
clang</strong> despite the fact it might appear to be gcc: no symlink and both gcc and
clang exist but the gcc is clang which you’ll see if you run <code>gcc --version</code>.</p>
<p>A tip and some fix methods from Cody: in the older days args to main() not given
a type were implicit ints but when they’re required to be <code>char **</code> this can
cause a problem. In some cases Cody was able to use a <code>char *</code> inside <code>main()</code>
(see <a href="1989/tromp/tromp.c">1989/tromp/tromp.c</a> and
<a href="1986/holloway">1986/holloway/holloway.c</a> for two examples though done slightly
differently). In other cases he was able to dereference the pointers to be used
like an int and other times a cast was necessary. He used other various
techniques to get them to compile. In some cases this introduced a problem but
typically if not always that problem exists with compilers that are less strict.</p>
<h2 id="status-main-has-only-one-arg---try-and-make-it-have-2-or-3">STATUS: main() has only one arg - try and make it have 2 or 3</h2>
<p>Because some versions of clang complain about the number of args of <code>main()</code> and
in particular say (when it has four, for instance) that it’s only allowed to
have 0, 2 or 3 args, numerous entries had a second arg added to <code>main()</code> (if
they only had one). This is in case clang adds further restrictions which is not
impossible especially as it already claims having only one arg is not allowed.
At this time (04 Feb 2024) there is one entry known (it is possible that not all
were checked) that has this problem but it’s not as simple as the others to fix
without breaking it.</p>
<h2 id="status-compiled-executable-crashes---please-help-us-fix">STATUS: compiled executable crashes - please help us fix</h2>
<p>While such entries can compile, the resulting executable sometimes or always
crashes.</p>
<p>NOTE: this does NOT apply to entries under the INABIAF status (though they’re
not mutually exclusive in some cases).</p>
<p>REMINDER: if you’re debugging a crash it will be very helpful to have <code>-O0 -g</code>
or if you can <code>-ggdb3</code> when compiling as that will help with debugging symbols.</p>
<h2 id="status-uses-gets---change-to-fgets-if-possible">STATUS: uses gets() - change to fgets() if possible</h2>
<p>Entries with this status use <code>gets()</code> which is unsafe because it has no limit on
the length of the string. <a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone
Ferguson</a> has fixed several of these and he’s
working on others in between fixing other things.</p>
<p>There’s a very good reason for this even though it is bordering on tampering
entries: in modern systems one will get possibly alarming and certainly annoying
warnings during at least one of compiling, linking and execution. In macOS it’s
most annoying as it happens during execution (also compilation) with the warning
being interspersed with the output of the program, often causing confusing
output with the entry. A good example that was fixed is
<a href="1990/tbr/tbr.c">1990/tbr</a>.</p>
<p>Cody provided some important notes on this status with respect to fixing /
changing entries:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>In some cases changing the entry to use <code>fgets()</code> will break the entry and in
some cases cause it to crash. Where this is known we will document it. Some of
these Cody is also off and on working on.</p></li>
<li><p>You <strong>MUST</strong> check the output before and after to make sure that it remains
the same. Sometimes the output might not be immediately obviously wrong but is.
We will document known examples as we come across them.</p></li>
<li><p><code>gets()</code> does NOT STORE the <code>'\n'</code> but <code>fgets()</code> DOES! This is one of the
reasons some of the entries break when changed to <code>fgets()</code>. Cody has fixed some
of these but there are others he hasn’t had time to address or even discover
yet.</p></li>
<li><p>Just because you don’t see the string <code>gets</code> in the code does not mean it’s
not used. It is after all the International <em>Obfuscated C Code</em> Contest! :-)
Sometimes it will be in the Makefile and other times it will be obfuscated in
other ways. Compilers and linkers tend to warn about its use (and as noted in
macOS it also happens at execution) and this is a good way to find entries that
use it even if it’s not visible in the code.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: this status is <em>NOT necessarily mutually exclusive</em> with the <em>INABIAF</em>
(it’s not a bug it’s a feature) status. The reason for this is due to warnings
during compiling, linking and/or runtime, sometimes causing confusing output (as
noted above).</p>
<p>Sometimes <code>getline(3)</code> will work but note that this function also stores the
newline just like <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="status-missing-files---please-provide-them">STATUS: missing file(s) - please provide them</h2>
<p>In these entries one file or multiple files are missing from the repo. In some
cases these files can be found on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org">IOCCC website</a> but
in other cases they are entirely absent. In this case you’ll probably have to
contact the author (unless you are the author! :-) ).</p>
<h2 id="status-missing-make-rules---please-provide-them">STATUS: missing make rules - please provide them</h2>
<p>In these entries one or more make rules noted by the author and/or judges is/are
missing. You might consider looking at the <a href="archive">archive</a> as a good place
to find them.</p>
<h2 id="status-missing-or-dead-link---please-provide-them">STATUS: missing or dead link - please provide them</h2>
<p>This is as they sound: a link is either missing or it’s no longer valid. In many
cases the <a href="https://web.archive.org">Internet Wayback Machine</a> will be very
useful but there happens to be numerous links that this is not helpful. In other
cases the URL has changed. Some of these have been discovered by the Internet
Wayback Machine with the orange status.</p>
<h3 id="statuses-of-internet-wayback-machine-archive">Statuses of Internet Wayback Machine archive:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Green (3xx): redirect (this has been used to find changes in URL).</li>
<li>Orange (4xx): not found etc.</li>
<li>Blue: this is a good link (but note that this doesn’t mean that it’s correct!).</li>
</ul>
<p>The archive website will tell you if the link was never captured.</p>
<h2 id="status-inabiaf---please-do-not-fix">STATUS: INABIAF - please <strong>DO NOT</strong> fix</h2>
<h3 id="inabiaf-its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature--">INABIAF: It’s not a bug it’s a feature :-)</h3>
<p>Entries with this status should NOT be touched (unless they have another status
that suggests that <em>that</em> issue can be changed): they are system specific by
design or are other things that are not actually bugs or bugs even if they
appear to be. Or they might be documented bugs or things that simply are part of
the entry. Nonetheless they are noteworthy.</p>
<p>NOTE: the definition of this status changed over time. At one point it was when
something was noted by the author, the judges, a consequence of earlier
requirements for winning entries or the purpose was to do something that might
appear to be buggy. An example of system specific entries:</p>
<p><a href="1984/mullender/mullender.c">1984/mullender</a> (see below and the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>
for a version that works in modern systems) is very system specific and was
before system specific winning entries were discouraged. This is an all time
personal favourite of Landon Curt Noll. Run the alternate code to understand why
this might be (along with how strange the source code is :-) ).</p>
<p>An example where a crash is not a bug: <a href="2019/endoh/endoh.c">2019/endoh</a> is
supposed to crash. There are others that are also supposed to crash or that are
known to segfault but are considered features.</p>
<p>An important note is that if the index.html of the entry has a bug status that
says it can be fixed it can be. Otherwise it should not be.</p>
<p>Nonetheless we challenge you to fix these entries for educational/instructional
value and/or enjoyment but we kindly request that you <strong>DO NOT</strong> submit a pull
request unless it’s a bug or (mis)feature we would like you to fix! If you can’t
figure it out you’re invited to look at the git diffs, where there are some
(some were fixed earlier on but rolled back as both Cody and Landon individually
felt that the fix was tampering with the entry).</p>
<p>NOTE: in the case of <code>gets()</code> we’ve fixed some to avoid the warning of the
compiler, linker or even during runtime, depending on the system. In <a href="1990/tbr/tbr.c">some cases
like 1990/tbr</a> the fix actually prevents confusing output (though that
was not the only fix made in that entry).</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ./decot</span>

<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">\</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>without a newline after the <code>\</code>. This is not a bug.</p>

<p>Cody added and fixed the <a href="1984/mullender/gentab.c">gentab.c</a> which is from the
author’s (or one of them, Mullender) remarks found by Cody. Cody fixed this to
compile and work (as best as he can determine: he has no VAX-11 or PDP-11 or
emulator to test it) but running the code on the binary itself produces a
<code>short[]</code> that can compile in modern systems though it’ll not work.</p>

<p>With version 2 it sometimes segfaults even with the same input where other times
it does not. We don’t believe this is because of the fix that lets some versions
be compiled with clang. An example invocation is:</p>

<p>Fixing the (Mis)feature is likely to be a very difficult challenge especially
without breaking something else which is far more likely (see below in tips from
Cody). You are welcome to try and fix it if you can!</p>
<h3 id="tips-from-cody">Tips from Cody:</h3>
<p>The reason this is crashing is that the array <code>irk</code> is being accessed way out of
bounds by the int <code>gnat</code>. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  0x0000000000401335 in main (ABBA@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, tang@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, gnat@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;, Near@entry=&lt;optimized out&gt;)

<h3 id="magic-of-the-entry">Magic of the entry:</h3>
<p>The real trouble is that the code is generated and in a complex way or rather
ways.</p>
<p>I will explain this a little bit (though it might be more than a bit according
to many :-) ) but that is all I can do for now. The program, when used without
any args, will print out what it reads. If one arg is specified it will do a
ROT13 of it. If two args are specified it will print out the text backwards
(<em>WITHOUT ROT13!</em>). If three args are specified it will do both <strong><em>reversal AND
ROT13</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So <code>ver0</code> is the same as the main program; <code>ver1</code> is the ROT13 of the code (but
see below); <code>ver2</code> will reverse the code and <code>ver3</code> will both reverse and ROT13
the code. But it’s trickier than that as one might expect.</p>
<p>The comments are processed too. Furthermore it happens that the last line
becomes the first and the first line becomes the last! Now if you look at the
code you’ll see on the first line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/**//*/};)/**/</span>pain<span class="op">(*</span><span class="co">//**/tang     ,gnat/**//*/,ABBA~,0-0(avnz;)0-0,tang,raeN</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In <code>ver0</code> it’ll be the same but the others are more interesting.</p>
<p>In <code>ver1</code> you’ll see on the last line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>cnva<span class="op">((</span>vag<span class="op">)</span>NOON<span class="op">&amp;</span><span class="dv">2</span><span class="co">/*//*\\**/</span><span class="op">,</span>gnat<span class="op">,</span>tang    <span class="op">,</span>NOON<span class="co">/**//*/(niam/**/</span><span class="op">);}</span><span class="co">/*//**/</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and on the first line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">/**//*/};)/**/</span>cnva<span class="op">(*</span><span class="co">//**/gnat     ,tang/**//*/,NOON~,0-0(niam;)0-0,gnat,enrA</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Observe that the ROT13 of <code>pain</code> is <code>cnva</code> and the ROT13 of <code>main</code> is <code>znva</code>.
The ROT13 of <code>NOON</code> is <code>ABBA</code>. <code>vag</code> is ROT13 of <code>int</code>, <code>gnat</code> and <code>tang</code> are
ROT13 of each other as well which is the reverse of the original (this is not
because it goes backwards (it doesn’t in this version) but because they are
ROT13 pairs!). <code>main</code> spelt backwards is <code>niam</code> and <code>pain</code> spelt backwards is
<code>niap</code>. Furthermore see the Makefile for other defines that had to be specified
and for ver2 and ver3 (that both work with gcc) one had to be undefined (search
for <code>CDEFINE</code> and <code>-U</code>). These details will be important momentarily.</p>
<p>As far as <code>NOON</code> and <code>ABBA</code> being ROT13 pairs, notice how <code>NOON</code> is not in the
original code but <code>ABBA</code> is; but in other versions it becomes <code>NOON</code> and they
also have <code>abba</code> which the original code does not!</p>
<p>Now notice how the <code>avnz</code> in the first line got changed to <code>niam</code>, its ROT13
value. Notice also how some of these are in comments!</p>
<p><code>main()</code> is in there somewhere and that had to be changed to call
<code>pain()</code> (see the <a href="thanks-for-help.html#1989_westley">thanks</a>
file (see the <em>1989/westley</em> section for details on how as this was
not as straight forward as it is for other entries) as well. Now
if you notice on that line you have in a comment <code>niam</code>. If you
were to change that to <code>niap</code> (pain backwards) that function would
end up as <code>pain()</code> in generated code! That’s assuming that it’s
just the reversal version, of course but ver1 is the ROT13 version.</p>
<p>These facts are bad enough but then you throw in the reverse of it without ROT13
and then another version that has the reversal <em>and</em> ROT13 then you can see it’s
nigh impossible to fix if not impossible.</p>
<p>The fix to get it to even compile with clang and then get the first two
(counting the original, <code>ver0</code>) to work was the hardest fix I made due to how
the comments in reverse and ROT13 of it all works together, especially allowing
all versions to compile with gcc. The only reason that it doesn’t work
completely with clang is the arg types of main() (see if you can figure out how
the change of <code>main()</code> in <code>westley.c</code> is not carried over to versions 2 and 3!);
originally none of them compiled with clang.</p>
<p>But it was possible to get the ROT13 code to compile with clang but the other
versions, reversed as well as ROT13 and reversed code, proved much more
problematic. I got it to compile (or maybe mostly compile) all versions with
clang but I then carried it over to gcc in another system and it had syntax
errors.</p>
<p>That’s about all I can say for how it works as other things have to be done too.
Enjoy! :-)</p>

<p>they will get just</p>
<pre><code>oops</code></pre>
<p>which seems to be an error message (one of the fixes was to make it not use
<code>perror(3)</code> - this fixed something else though it’s no longer known what).</p>
<p>The script <a href="1990/jaw/shark.sh">shark.sh</a> has some issues too in that due to
path not having <code>.</code> (this and maybe some other things were fixed) and <code>tar</code> not
wanting to accept reading from <code>stdin</code> (this in particular) even with the right
options used, seemingly, it has to write to disk the tarball which seems to
defeat the purpose. This would ideally be fixed.</p>

<p>The author stated that if the file cannot be opened then it will print a system
error but this is not the case unless it’s showing a fault. However this was
instead fixed by Cody as part of another problem that was detected so that the
program just exits 1 if the file cannot be opened.</p>
<p>Also, if <em>some</em> of the programs are not given an arg they will very likely crash
or do something funny. For instance <code>adsleep</code> and <code>adbasename</code>. This is very
simple to fix but the author explicitly noted that this will segfault and it is
that that is the error message.</p>
<p>Another thing is that the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>printf<span class="op">((</span>W<span class="op">,</span>Y<span class="op">));</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>appears to be wrong because <code>W</code> is a <code>FILE *</code> and <code>Y</code> is a <code>char[]</code> but if one
changes it to use <code>fprintf()</code> on the file (which, incidentally, is opened in
read only mode which is another reason) with the <code>%s</code> specifier it will make
<code>adhead</code> not work: it’ll print nothing at all! So this code should not be
changed either even if it appears to be wrong. Notice too a curious thing: if
you did change it to fprintf, even if you have the right number of args, you’d
have to remove the outer <code>()</code> pair.</p>

<p>Leo Broukhis, before he was an IOCCC judge, sent the IOCCC judges an email:</p>

To: judges _at_ toad -dot- com
Subject: IOCCC 1992 - a bug

Dear Judges,

albert.c (even in its fixed form) still has a bug. Although I don&#39;t
remember the number that exposed the bug (afair, resulting in coredump)
in albert.orig.c that has been fixed in albert.c,

 &#39;ve found a number exposing another bug: 10000000001 (that&#39;s 9 0&#39;s).
Both albert and albert.orig loop without printing anything, although
the first factor is 101 and is usually found in an instant.</code></pre>
<p>A quick debugging session from Cody suggests that the problem with this value
is that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(</span> ppp<span class="op">-&gt;</span>qq<span class="op">!=</span><span class="dv">48</span> <span class="op">)</span> <span class="cf">return</span><span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>is never reached because the value is never 48 (it is in other cases but not for
the example input). It varies in value at this point. Observe that the next
lines of code are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">while</span> <span class="op">(</span> ppp<span class="op">-&gt;</span>qq<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">48</span> <span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    printf<span class="op">(</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="sc">%ld\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span>qqq<span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">45</span><span class="op">);</span></span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">*</span>pp <span class="op">=</span> ppp<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    ppp <span class="op">=</span> ppp<span class="op">-&gt;</span>p<span class="op">;</span></span>
<span id="cb17-6"><a href="#cb17-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>so it is expected that that value is 48, before printing the numbers, but if
it’s not it should not proceed at all, not even to go past that loop. In other
words that loop should always be entered for at least one iteration. The check
for the <code>!= 48</code> is also required.</p>
<p>Perhaps more useful to know is that at this point in the code the code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="op">(((((</span> <span class="op">!(</span>aa<span class="op">=</span>setjmp<span class="op">(</span>ppp<span class="op">-&gt;</span>ppp<span class="op">))||</span>aa<span class="op">==</span>aaaaaa <span class="op">)))))</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>appears to be entered because of the return value of <code>setjmp()</code>, not the other
condition.</p>
<p>The alt version does fix the problem but it is not obfuscated and not like the
entry itself. Can you fix the actual entry? You are welcome to try and do so.</p>

<h3 id="information-1992gsonindex.html1992gsonindex.html">Information: [1992/gson/index.html])(1992/gson/index.html)</h3>
<p>Cody changed it so that the buffer size is <code>ARG_MAX+1</code> to try and get past the
problem of <code>gets()</code> being used in a more complex way.</p>
<p>It would be ideal if it were to use <code>fgets()</code> though. This will probably be
looked at later but you’re welcome to try and fix this too! A tip on how
<code>gets()</code> is being used from Cody:</p>
<p>Previously it had a buffer size of 256 which could easily overflow. In this
entry <code>gets(3)</code> is used in a more complicated way: first <code>m</code> is set to <code>*++p</code> in
a for loop where <code>p</code> is argv. Later <code>m</code> is set to point to <code>h</code> which was of size
256. <code>gets(3)</code> is called as <code>m = gets(m)</code>) but trying to change it to use
<code>fgets(3)</code> proved more a problem. Since the input must come from the command
line Cody changed the buffer size to <code>ARG_MAX+1</code> which should be enough (again
theoretically) especially since the command expects redirecting a dictionary
file as part of the command line. This also makes it possible for longer strings
to be read (in case the <code>gets(3)</code> was not used in a loop).</p>

<p>We used a patch from <a href="authors.html#Yusuke_Endoh">Yusuke Endoh</a> to get this to
work but it only works with gcc. Cody removed the warnings of <code>gets()</code> and
provided a script to run the entry properly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to the way the entry works and the fact that other compilers
like clang have different warnings and errors this simply does not work with
them.</p>
<p>Some tips from Cody:</p>
<p>This entry relies on specific compiler warnings. With gcc it will look something
like:</p>
<pre><code>[...]
lush.c: In function &#39;main&#39;:
lush.c:40: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
   40 |           main
      |
lush.c:1: note: this is the location of the previous definition
    1 | #define gets(_) fgets((_),999,stdin)
      |
lush.c:42: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
   42 | #define f 001:
      |
lush.c:40: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   40 |           main
      |
lush.c:44: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
   44 | #define f 100:
      |
lush.c:42: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   42 | #define f 001:
      |
lush.c:45: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
   45 |          _[i--
      |
lush.c:44: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   44 | #define f 100:
      |
lush.c:46: warning: &quot;f&quot; redefined
   46 | #define f 126:
      |
lush.c:45: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   45 |          _[i--
      |</code></pre>
<p>Now one can use <code>sed</code> to get the <code>warning:</code> line correct but there is more to it
than that. For instance this is what it looks like with clang:</p>
<pre><code>lush.c:40:9: warning: &#39;f&#39; macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]
#define f 001:
        ^
lush.c:1:9: note: previous definition is here
#define f 000:
        ^
lush.c:42:9: warning: &#39;f&#39; macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]
#define f 100:
        ^
lush.c:40:9: note: previous definition is here
#define f 001:
        ^</code></pre>
<p>As you might see the part under the <code>warning:</code> line is different.</p>
<p>The entry is supposed to show warnings and then print:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World.</code></pre>
<p>Can you help us?</p>

<p>Cody improved the usability of this program by making it so that as long as the
terminal columns is &gt;= 80 it will display properly, rather than having to wrap
at 80 columns. However due to the nature of the program if the terminal is &lt; 80
in column width it will not display right. To see the number of columns in your
terminal try:</p>

<p>…going down the left edge if your terminal auto-wraps at 80 characters.</p>
<p>This however does not seem to work. It does not appear to be because of the fix
for modern systems as it doesn’t work for gcc either, even before any changes.
This might be a misunderstanding or it might be that having 80 columns (resized)
does not count (though the output before the fix of the 80 column requirement
showed was correct when at 80-columns so it seems like this could be a bug if
not a misunderstanding).</p>

<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed this to compile
with modern systems (see the <a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a> file for
what had to change) but the entry also used <code>gets()</code> which in some systems would
print out a warning along with the output of the program. Naturally it could
also overflow long lines. Cody changed it to <code>fgets()</code> to prevent the display
problem but this introduces another problem namely that newlines can be printed
if the line length &lt; 231.</p>
<p>This seems like a worthy compromise to not have messed up output and although it
would be ideal for it to never print a newline unless that’s the line itself it
might be tampering too much with the entry as it’s not a real problem and as a
one liner it’s already quite long.</p>

<p>NOTE: the generated code of all versions, when fed its own source, will differ
even when it works. See the author’s remarks in the index.html for details.
Increasing the buffer size and having it, when fed its own source code,
generate code that will compile with the same buffer size is difficult: it just
uses the original size. Cody explains this further down.</p>
<p>Getting it to use <code>fgets()</code> is even harder as when fed its own code it will
generate code that cannot even compile let alone use <code>fgets(3)</code>.</p>
<p>In both cases, changing the buffer size and changing it to use <code>fgets(3)</code>, will
cause compilation errors without other adjustments.</p>
<p>See the below magic for details. Along with the author’s remarks in the
index.html file it might prove possible to get it to use <code>fgets(3)</code>. Cody,
writing this on 02 November 2023, only just noticed the author’s remarks and
will later on look at this if nobody takes up the challenge. More important work
like getting to a place that the next contest can run must be done first.</p>
<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> explains the magic of
how this entry works, which will be necessary if this entry is to be fixed,
below.</p>
<p>You might wish to run the command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">make</span> diff_orig_prog</span></code></pre></div>
<p>to see what had to change for the buffer size, when looking at the below.
Furthermore you will want to look at:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb29-1"><a href="#cb29-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">diff</span> schnitzi.alt.c schnitzi.alt2.c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>as the <code>fgets()</code> version can compile it just can’t generate compilable code (let
alone using <code>fgets()</code>) when fed itself (to reiterate, just changing the call to
<code>fgets(3)</code> does not mean it can compile and there’s a further problem in that
<code>fgets(3)</code> retains the newline whereas <code>gets(3)</code> does not). Nevertheless looking
at these commands will be of help to understand how it works.</p>
<p>For the alternate versions the other functionality is unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="the-magic-of-1994schnitzi-and-how-it-flips-text">The magic of <a href="1994/schnitzi/schnitzi.c">1994/schnitzi</a> and how it flips text</h3>
<p>The problem is getting the generated code to use <code>fgets()</code> (once it even
compiles which was easy to do) and also have the updated buffer size be the
same (which was easy to do too at least in the original version). The generated
output, when changed to <code>fgets()</code> failed to compile and it also used <code>gets(3)</code>
and these are the bugs here.</p>
<p>The buffer size, when using <code>gets()</code> is still the same but as noted above the
original code has had a buffer size increase.</p>
<p>The real problem is with formatting the code. Take a look at the interesting
comment as well as the <code>int r=0,x,y=0</code> at the top of the file. If you look at
each column go down that column you can see how it spells out the code! For
instance the first column looks like:</p>
<pre><code>i
n
c
l
u
d
e

&lt;
s
t
d
i
o
.
h
&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you join the lines you end up with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb31"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb31-1"><a href="#cb31-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you look at column 25 which is the end of the word ‘mh111’ and you go down to
the next row you’ll see a 0 and if you go one row down another 0. This is the
buffer size, 100, for <code>u</code>! The column to the left is the same for the <code>t</code>
variable.</p>
<p>Thus it seems that in order to get the generated output correct one needs to
provide the correct input in comments or possibly by rearranging some of the
code (this was actually required to make the generated code compile at all when
changing the buffer size, see below).</p>
<h3 id="important-points">Important points:</h3>
<p>Getting this entry to use <code>fgets()</code> is easy but the problem is you’re supposed
to be able to feed the source to the program and the output of that will be
compilable. It however will create compiler errors. So it’s not just changing
the code to get it to use fgets()! I (Cody) already did this before I noticed
the other part which is why I rolled that part back. I did increase the buffer
size but that only works on the original source.</p>
<p>To say just how sensitive this entry is: even a space, lack of space or a
character, wrong character, lack of character or character in the wrong place
can cause a compilation error! Make sure that the output of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./schnitzi</span> <span class="op">&lt;</span> schnitzi.c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>can be compiled and the output of that new program when fed itself can also be
compiled!</p>

<h3 id="important-reminder-and-a-note-about-the--1-value-check-for-getc">Important reminder and a note about the <code>-1</code> value check for <code>getc()</code>:</h3>
<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed the code to not
use <code>-1</code> for the return value of <code>getc()</code>; this is important because <code>EOF</code> is
<strong>NOT</strong> guaranteed to be <code>-1</code> but rather any negative value. On systems where
<code>EOF != -1</code> the program would enter an infinite loop until the program crashed,
by chance reads a <code>-1</code> or was killed (it is for this same reason that one should
not use <code>EOF</code> for the <code>getopt()</code> functions as they return <code>-1</code> when all options
are parsed (for details on the definition of <code>EOF</code> see <code>7.21 Input/output&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> subsection 1 of the standard)).</p>
<p>An interesting problem occurred where changing the <code>-1</code> to <code>EOF</code> caused both
<code>warning: illegal character encoding in string literal</code> and <code>error: source file is not valid UTF-8</code>. But since <code>EOF</code> is simply an int &lt; 0 and making the loop
condition check that the return value is &gt;= 0 does not cause a compilation error
and it functions correctly it will address the systems where <code>EOF != -1</code> just as
if it checked for <code>!= EOF</code>.</p>
<p>Since it works there is no need to fix this except for a challenge to yourself.</p>

fixed these problems.</p>
<p>It should be noted however that there is a condition where the program will
prompt you to press return again. This was thought to be a bug but looking at
the code it can clearly be seen that if <code>g - a</code> is 0 then the message is
supposed to be printed again and one is supposed to press a key as at that point
it calls <code>getchar()</code> via the pointer <code>m</code>. So this is a feature not a bug.</p>

<p>A point worth considering is that as the number passed into the program gets
bigger the number of lines of output gets substantially larger. For instance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb37-1"><a href="#cb37-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> ./schnitzi 9<span class="kw">|</span><span class="fu">wc</span> <span class="at">-l</span></span>
<span id="cb37-2"><a href="#cb37-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="ex">771999</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The larger the number the bigger the file can become too, even becoming
gigabytes in size. The range is checked for <code>&gt;0 &amp;&amp; &lt;27</code> as not having this can
be a problem including a segfault.</p>
<p>If you use the generated program and do not give enough numbers in input
something funny will happen, very possibly with different results per run. This
is in the index.html file as something to try and ponder.</p>

<p>This <strong>MIGHT</strong> be better described as doesn’t work with some versions of perl:
the author states that in perl &lt; 5.6.0 there is a bug with a core dump in what
they said is in <code>Perl_sv_upgrade</code>. This does not exist in the code, seemingly,
but it might be that this is impossible to fix without getting a perl upgrade.
In any event the below details a problem. Another bug that happens in linux also
is below.</p>
<p>In macOS this program crashes. A tip from Cody is that the code that crashes is:</p>

<p>and in particular it appears that it is the perl itself. In other words if one
changes it to be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="#cb39-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>perl_eval_sv<span class="op">(</span>newSVpv<span class="op">(</span><span class="st">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="op">,</span><span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">),</span><span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>it will not crash. But of course it won’t do anything either. So it’s more
specifically that the call to <code>newSVpv()</code> crashes the code but <em>INSIDE</em>
(key point!) the call to <code>perl_eval_sv()</code> that does it. Given what the author
stated and that the version of perl is &lt; than 5.6.0 that might be exactly what
is going on.</p>
<p>The example command above <em>should</em> print:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="#cb40-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;13 14 15 16 17 + - * / p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span></span>
<span id="cb40-2"><a href="#cb40-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">-0.0515873015873016</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and that’s what it shows in linux.</p>
<p>Note that with different perl libraries in macOS (for instance from
<a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> and <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> it will
likely print different warnings when compiling. It was observed that with
Homebrew it does not report any warnings but with MacPorts it results in a total
of 92 warnings! Nonetheless neither works okay and both crash.</p>
<h3 id="status-known-bug---please-help-us-fix-11">STATUS: known bug - please help us fix</h3>
<p>The author gives an example command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="#cb41-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">tr</span> 876 tpo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which should print out <code>poot</code> but it doesn’t, not in linux and not in macOS.</p>
<p>In linux it doesn’t crash but it doesn’t print anything out either.</p>
<p>In macOS it crashes; it might appear to not crash in macOS but this is because
of the pipeline. If you remove the <code>| tr 876 tpo</code> part of the command you will
see that it does indeed crash!</p>
<p>The reason for this not working is really strange.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span></span>

<span id="cb42-4"><a href="#cb42-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Why? Is it writing to stdout? Let’s try some other things:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb43-1"><a href="#cb43-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo 7668 <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">tr</span> 876 tpo</span>
<span id="cb43-2"><a href="#cb43-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">poot</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay so we know that it SHOULD work. But we also know something funny is going on with stdout and the entry. Another experiment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="#cb44-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="dv">2</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> 7</span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="#cb44-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">7668</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay so now it sees it, <code>grep</code>. But watch!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="#cb45-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">&gt;</span>foo <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb45-2"><a href="#cb45-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">7668</span></span>
<span id="cb45-3"><a href="#cb45-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> cat foo</span></code></pre></div>
<p>.. so at this hour it does appear to be writing to stdout but yet somehow it doesn’t? But watch:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb46-1"><a href="#cb46-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo <span class="st">&quot;7 P 6 d P P 8 p&quot;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">&gt;</span>foo <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">&gt;&amp;</span><span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb46-2"><a href="#cb46-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> cat foo</span>
<span id="cb46-3"><a href="#cb46-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Well this explains why the <code>tr</code> does not transliterate it to <code>poot</code> but why is
this happening? Why can’t it be redirected to another file even?</p>
<p>If it could be figured out why it’s not writing to stdout and yet at the same
time is writing to stdout one bug could be fixed. Maybe it’s the perl messing
with things but we don’t know.</p>
<p>Other commands do work, however, and give the appropriate output, such as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb47"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb47-1"><a href="#cb47-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo 1 2 + p <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span></span>
<span id="cb47-2"><a href="#cb47-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>so something is wrong with some commands/operators.</p>
<p>Another feature that does work in linux is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb48-1"><a href="#cb48-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo poot <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe</span></span>
<span id="cb48-2"><a href="#cb48-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">poot</span> was here!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Can you help fix these problems?</p>
<p>Cody provided the C code that creates an unformatted perl script that will just
print ‘unimplemented’ for operators but it seems to work in some other ways (see
below for how to go further than unimplemented) which is the exact perl from the
C program except that it has the <code>#!/usr/bin/env perl</code> and <code>use warnings;</code> as
well. A note below might suggest that doing this creates incomplete perl.
Anyway:</p>

<p>Here is example input/output:</p>
<pre><code>p
stack empty
5 p
5
5 + 5 p
unimplemented
5
P
5
p
5</code></pre>
<p>So you can see that if one uses operators it just shows ‘unimplemented’ (observe
how this does not happen in the C program in linux!) but if one uses ‘p’ by
itself it will print what’s on the stack (for example).</p>
<p>To not get ‘unimplemented’ you can remove from the perl:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb52"><pre class="sourceCode perl"><code class="sourceCode perl"><span id="cb52-1"><a href="#cb52-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">sub </span><span class="fu">AUTOLOAD</span> { print<span class="ot">&quot;</span><span class="st">unimplemented</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="ot">&quot;</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(Note that the author stated this was used for exception handling so another
possibility is that the C code doesn’t generate the correct perl and indeed even
spaces is known to break the perl in at least one way, syntax errors, but maybe
others too.)</p>
<p>Here is an example run of several operations in the perl script after removing
that subroutine:</p>

<p>Note the undefined subroutine error: that happens with commands that are not
even in the program. Again the author used <code>AUTOLOAD</code> for exception handling so
it seems likely that there is something missing (which the below shows as well).
For instance inputting <code>D</code> followed by <code>XX</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Undefined subroutine &amp;main::nn called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 6.
Undefined subroutine &amp;main::[[ called at ./pl.pl line 2, &lt;&gt; line 1.</code></pre>
<p>That means then that in linux despite the subroutines seemingly not existing it
works in the code, at least in some cases.</p>
<p>As far as the unimplemented error goes: the author stated that it means there is
invalid input. But as can be seen by the input I (Cody) gave the input is not
actually incorrect. It is also curious to note that it ends up printing what’s
on the stack at that point:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb55"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb55-1"><a href="#cb55-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">$</span> echo 5 5 + p <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./dlowe.pl</span></span>
<span id="cb55-2"><a href="#cb55-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">unimplemented</span></span>
<span id="cb55-3"><a href="#cb55-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which might (?) suggest that the <code>+</code> operator is unimplemented. Unfortunately it
has been many years since I have used perl and I was never a guru either.</p>

<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed this so that it
doesn’t segfault and then also fixed the functionality of it (but see below).</p>
<p>Cody also fixed the <a href="2001/anonymous/anonymous.ten.c">anonymous.ten.c</a> program
(it also segfaulted) but notes that it <strong>MUST</strong> be compiled as a <strong>32-bit ELF
binary</strong> so it will NOT work in macOS (for example); if you cannot use <code>-m32</code> or
even if you can but it cannot compile as an ELF binary (not elf binary :-) )
(but see below) then the <code>anonymous</code> program itself will very likely crash if
you run it on the compiled <a href="2001/anonymous/anonymous.ten.c">anonymous.ten.c</a> but
if nothing else it will not modify the target executable (this part of the fix
at least should be correct).</p>
<p>The file <code>2001/anonymous/anonymous.ten.32</code> is a pre-compiled
<a href="2001/anonymous.ten.c">2001/anonymous.ten.c</a> as a 32-bit ELF binary in case you
can run ELF binaries but cannot compile 32-bit binaries.</p>
<p>Other BSD Unices were not tested.</p>
<p>Note also that if you don’t specify a file or you specify a non-32-bit ELF file
this program will very likely crash or do something strange like slaughter the
elves of Imladris :-(</p>

<p>The two statuses might seem contradictory but that is a complicated question.
The author stated that it only works with i386 linux so on the one hand the fact
it doesn’t work in modern systems is considered a feature and not a bug. But on
the other hand it would be nice if there was an alternate version which worked
for modern systems. This does seem quite unlikely but some fixes, described
next, were made.</p>
<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed an initial
segfault (trying to open the file) and he also fixed the <a href="2001/bellard/bellard.otccex.c">supplementary program
bellard.otccex.c</a> but this still crashes in
systems not i386 linux which is what the author stated.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you do have a fix for 64-bit systems you’re welcome to
provide it as an alternate version. If by chance you have a fix so that it works
for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems that is also okay.</p>
<p>The author said that they compiled it with <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-2.95.2/gcc-everything-2.95.2.tar.gz">gcc version
2.95.2</a>. We
don’t know if a certain gcc version is necessary but it might be helpful to
download and compile that version to test it - or it might not.</p>
<p>I (Cody) have no i386 system to test this but perhaps this is why I can’t get it
to work. Yusuke was able to get this to work with <code>-m32</code> but only in an
emulator.</p>
<p>On the author’s <a href="https://bellard.org/otcc/">web page for this program</a> it is
explicitly stated that it requires i386 linux.</p>
<p>There I found what should be a more portable version which is included as
<a href="2001/bellard/otccelf.c">otccelf.c</a> (after adding some <code>#include</code>s and the
modification by Yusuke noted in the <a href="thanks-for-help.html">thanks</a>
file) but it appears this <em>also</em> requires i386 linux; indeed looking at the code
it hard codes paths that are i386 specific to linux.</p>
<p>Another point of interest is that the author provided de-obfuscated versions
which might be of value to look at. I might do that as well but this entry is
very likely never going to work for 64-bit linux so that’s not that likely since
there are other things that are more important.</p>
<p>If you have a fix for 64-bit systems this is welcome as an alternate version, as
stated above. You might like to look at the otccelf version but note that it (at
least in 64-bit linux and macOS) has compilation errors.</p>
<h3 id="aside-why-were-there-changes-made-if-inabiaf">Aside: why were there changes made if INABIAF ?</h3>
<p>This is a good question. The reason is we believe it better to fix some obvious
problems: there were some bugs that would very possibly prevent it from working
even if it was in i386 linux though Yusuke seemed to get it to work in an
emulator so perhaps not. Still it’s better to have the type of the file pointer
correct and so that the file can at least be opened in modern systems even if
the compiler won’t work there.</p>
<p>Also the supplementary program, which did not work at all, was fixed (by Cody)
and it can be run by itself for fun in modern systems, which was not possible
before the fixes there.</p>

<p>Sometimes when one player presses <code>q</code> it will result in broken pipe on the other
end.</p>
<p>The author also noted that some versions of <code>curses</code> have problems with
<code>getch()</code> having a delay.</p>
<p>The program is very likely to segfault if the specified port can’t be bound or
connected to.</p>
<p>If the terminal is too wide (the author suggests over 500 characters) the
program can segfault.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to crash the program if a player scores over a billion
points.</p>
<p>Although it is independent of endianness both systems need the same character
set. In other words both have to be ASCII or EBCDIC - not one of each.</p>

<p>This program only has one arg to <code>main()</code>. However changing it to have 2 is not
as simple as it might seem. Doing this breaks things. If memory serves changing
it to two will, for instance, break the punch card code output. It might be that
that is for <code>fgets(3)</code>, however, but the point remains: in order to test any
fixes you must determine if the extra files generated (some from <code>sort(1)</code>) -
see the index.html file - generate correct output as well as that the main entry
does too. You might try running the <code>try.sh</code> script and redirect it to a file
first so that you can compare the output. Make sure to recreate the extra files
as described by the author if you do fix this. This might be looked at later if
nobody else takes up the challenge.</p>

<p>There seem to be a couple bugs at least in this entry. The first one is that
when it does reach a certain point it crashes. This is in the function <code>J()</code> (or
one it calls?). But sometimes it seems to not get that far, just showing lines
moving back and forth. This is also in <code>J()</code>. It is not confirmed but it might
be that the lines are drawn by <code>XDrawString()</code>, the last part in <code>J()</code>.</p>
<p><code>J()</code> has a <code>for</code> loop identified by <code>for</code> and also a couple <code>while</code> loops,
identified by <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>Since the game never ends properly the score is not printed either.</p>
<p>It appears that the crash happens in more than one place. For instance it has
happened at</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb57"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb57-1"><a href="#cb57-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>XCheckMaskEvent<span class="op">(</span>d<span class="op">,</span> <span class="dv">4</span><span class="op">,&amp;</span>e<span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>but it’s also happened at</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb58"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb58-1"><a href="#cb58-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">else</span> XDrawPoint<span class="op">(</span>d    <span class="op">,</span>w<span class="op">,</span>g<span class="op">,(</span>l<span class="op">.</span>s<span class="op">+=</span>l<span class="op">.</span>a<span class="op">)&gt;&gt;</span><span class="dv">9</span><span class="op">,</span>    h<span class="op">=(</span>l<span class="op">.</span>c<span class="op">+=</span>l<span class="op">.</span>b<span class="op">)&gt;&gt;</span><span class="dv">9</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In both cases the pointer <code>d</code> was corrupted:</p>
<pre><code>(lldb) p d
(Display *) 0x0000000000000001</code></pre>
<p>It is believed that it also happened at</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb60"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb60-1"><a href="#cb60-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>XDrawString<span class="op">(</span>d<span class="op">,</span>w<span class="op">,</span>g<span class="op">,</span>W<span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">,</span>H<span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">,</span>m<span class="op">,</span>B<span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>in <code>J()</code> and for the same reason.</p>
<p>The loop seems to be stuck in the call to <code>usleep(3)</code> like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb61"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb61-1"><a href="#cb61-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>usleep<span class="op">(</span>p<span class="op">*</span><span class="dv">200</span><span class="op">);</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>which happens to be in a <code>while()</code> loop.</p>
<p>There is a way to get the code to crash. If you don’t do anything until
everything is destroyed (where you’d lose the game if it ended) and then you
start to shoot your missiles repeatedly it will eventually crash. It appears not
to be the case (though this was not tried as many times) if you start shooting
when the missiles come down. The fact you can shoot after it starts that
sleeping in a loop does suggest that it’s not stuck only showing those lines and
sleeping.</p>

<p>The author stated that:</p>
<pre><code>Arguments matching `/[^2]22$/` cause the program to segfault
after rapidly exhausting the available stack space.  I could
probably fix this by adding some special cases to the code,
but [Blaine the Mono] it&#39;s quite a bit more exciting this way,
don&#39;t you think?[/Blaine]  Since the trailing `22` will be
its own atom anyway, you can just insert a space in front of
it if you run into this feature (e.g. `1 22` instead of `122`).

Arguments matching `/(?:.){10,}/` will produce visually incorrect
results (e.g., generation 1 starting from 1111111111 will
print as `: 1`), but there&#39;s nothing interesting about these
arguments that can&#39;t be modeled using shorter runs of the same
symbol.

Arguments matching `/(?:.){257,}/` may produce mathematically
incorrect results (e.g., generation 1 starting from a string
of 257 `1`s will be calculated as `11`); the remark from the
previous paragraph applies here also.</code></pre>

<p>This program sometimes will create unsolvable puzzles :-) just to hook you.
As a protection against this - and to prevent you from spending too much time on
such puzzles (or too big puzzles if you insist on doing this) - it deliberately
destroys its runtime stack. See the <a href="2005/anon/index.html">index.html</a> for more

<code>char-upcase</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Only one variable is available. This variable is called <code>q</code>, although any
symbol name starting with the letter <code>q</code> will be mapped to this variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Only the first letter of a function name is significant. For example,
<code>format</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>farm</code>, and various other words starting with <code>f</code> will all map to
the <code>format</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>defvar</code> function completely ignores its first parameter. It will always
store the result of evaluating its second parameter in <code>q</code>. Unlike in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common
Lisp</a>, multiple invocations of
<code>defvar</code> on the same variable will overwrite old values.</p></li>
<li><p>Character constants are limited to <code>#\Newline</code> and single-character
constants such as <code>#\x</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>char-upcase</code> function will give strange results if passed something
other than a lowercase character.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>format</code> function takes exactly three parameters. The first parameter is
ignored; output always goes to <code>stdout</code>. The second parameter must have exactly
one <code>~s</code> format specifier in it, and no other format specifiers are permitted.</p></li>
<li><p>The arithmetic functions take exactly two parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>All tokens must be separated from a following <code>)</code> by whitespace.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of other things. Notably, the language which this program interprets is
nowhere near
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing-complete</a>.</p></li>

workaround (perhaps with stunnel) or even add additional code to it to make it

set up in order to give http commands. This is not a bug but it’s worth pointing

<p>The author stated the below points of interest.</p>
<p>The machine emulated is an older 40 column one so 80 column programs will not
show up correctly.</p>
<p>There is no emulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET</a>
graphics characters.</p>
<p>The parameter controls the speed of the 60Hz “jiffy clock”, and not the
processor speed. This means many games may run too fast to be usable -
it really depends on the speed of your machine.</p>
<p>Although the PET <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulator</a> can do <code>LOAD</code>
and <code>SAVE</code>, it cannot <code>VERIFY</code> or <code>OPEN</code> and <code>CLOSE</code> files.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">PET</a> hardware
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulation</a> is not at all complete -
features such as the hardware timers are completely missing. Some programs will

<p>The author stated:</p>
<pre><code>If you pick a number higher than 19186, the program will return a
solution but it will be a rotation of one of the first 19186.  This is
because the cross shaped piece fits 48 ways in the 4x4 cube, but only
2 of those ways are unique - you can rotate one of those to make any
of the other 46.  The algorithm used always places the cross piece
first, so the first two placings of that piece result in the 19186
unique solutions.

If you pick a number higher than 460464 (24x19186) the program will
return without outputting a solution.  If you can wait that long.</code></pre>

<p>This does not appear to work with macOS, resulting in a segfault (and sometimes
a bus error).</p>
<p>We’re not sure if this is to do with the Apple silicon chip or not but it seems
like it <em>might</em> (see Apple resources below) be but it could also be a wider
problem with macOS. It appears that Apple does not allow certain combinations of
memory protections with the arm64 processor.</p>
<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> tried some of the
workarounds but at this time he could not get it to work. He offers some earlier
debugging sessions below as well as a resource from the author as well as some

address it later but a starting point might be in

<p>At first glance it appeared to be that it might be the function pointers or the
fact it is trying to execute code in memory (as noted above). The function
pointers were changed a bit but this has not helped solve the problem with
macOS. A few things that were noticed depending on <code>asan</code> sanitisers specified.
With <code>address</code> in linux:</p>
<pre><code>richards.c:101:9: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null</code></pre>
<p>but it actually works. This code is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb70"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb70-1"><a href="#cb70-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">else</span></span>

<span id="cb70-3"><a href="#cb70-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        W<span class="op">(</span>c<span class="op">)}</span> <span class="co">/* LINE 101 */</span></span>
<span id="cb70-4"><a href="#cb70-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay but what about argument 2? Well <code>W</code> is defined as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="#cb71-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">#define W</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="pp">c</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="pp"> e</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="pp">memmove</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="pp">e</span><span class="op">,</span><span class="pp">x</span><span class="op">[(</span>u<span class="op">)</span><span class="pp">c</span><span class="op">],</span><span class="pp"> y</span><span class="op">[(</span>u<span class="op">)</span><span class="pp">c</span><span class="op">])+</span><span class="pp">y</span><span class="op">[(</span>u<span class="op">)</span><span class="pp">c</span><span class="op">];</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>so it would appear that</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb72"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span id="cb72-1"><a href="#cb72-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>x<span class="op">[(</span>u<span class="op">)</span>c<span class="op">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(at least in my tired head?) is NULL. But why does it work then?</p>
<p>NOTE: <code>u</code> is <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>The author stated:</p>
<pre><code>The memory locations of `argv` are used for various purposes. Therefore, the
program name (default `deckmyn`) must be *at least 4 characters long*, including
possibly the path. This, along with the ending `&#39;\0&#39;`, gives a minimum 5 bytes of
useful memory space. Otherwise, the program may attempt to write outside the
string.

The code is quite sensitive. Errors in the input can lead to strange results.
The code does not read beyond the end of the music input, but that is about the
only error checking available. Any input that is not according to the rules in
the deckmyn.html, may cause errors.

The program has no special hardware limitations or requirements, other than 8bit
`char` (`signed` or `unsigned`) and two&#39;s complement negatives.

The limitations of using `char` as counters for e.g. the number of music staves
are minor. 127 staves to a page is rather a lot.

The file layout must be exactly the same as deckmyn.c though, only the locations
of space (`&quot; &quot;`) may differ.

Every element in the music is given by a string of *exactly* 3 characters. Any
violation of this will result in the rest of the music being interpreted in some
randomly wrong way. Notice that in a file, the newline is also a character!
Therefore, when preparing music in a file, care should be taken that the last
musical element of a line is only 2 characters!</code></pre>

<pre><code>If the input doesn&#39;t start with a valid program, that is,
if the interpreter reaches end-of-file during program parsing,
it will crash in some way. E.g. the following might dump core:

    echo -n &quot;U&quot; | ./tromp

Furthermore, the interpreter requires the initial encoded lambda term to be closed,
that is, variable n can only appear within at least &#39;n&#39; enclosing lambdas.
For instance, here the term &#39;\ 5&#39; is not closed, causing the interpreter to crash when
looking into a null-pointer environment:

    echo &quot;&gt;Hello, world&quot; | ./tromp

will likely dump core.

<p>This program will possibly crash or draw something strange with 0 args. Then
again it might not. :-) This is easy to fix but would add bytes and since the

yourself but please do NOT open a pull request for this: just do it as an
exercise to see if you understand the code.</p>

<p>–</p>
<p>This program supports only “Combinator-calculus style notation” of Lazy K.
“Unlambda style” and “Iota and Jot” style are not supported.</p>
<p>Also, it requires a space between identifiers. In short, use <code>(S K)</code> instead of
<code>(SK)</code>, “`sk”, <code>**i*i*i*ii*i*i*ii</code>, or <code>11111100011100</code>.</p>

bit of time before you can start it again if you want it to be able to bind to
the socket (which obviously you do). The source is out the scope of this

<p>The author noted that in macOS the colours might be wrong. They gave a solution.
However Cody didn’t see any problem with it and he beat the series many times.
Of course the game here is small and he’s practically blind and it’s been a
while since he last played so it might be wrong. Nevertheless the author does
give a way to reconfigure the colours.</p>
<p>The author noted that the character cannot go through walls and the impression
is that this is how it was believed but Cody ironically pointed out that there
are known glitches where in some places you actually could go through walls.
This might even have applied to the arcade version, Mario Bros, though that can
no longer be confirmed by Cody. The point here is that in this game you cannot
go through walls but it’s not a bug.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the author also stated:</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>When the <code>Super character</code> becomes bigger (<code>ZOOM</code> flag), the character can
collide with blocks and get stuck inside them. This is a KNOWN BUG. When your
player become bigger, stay away from blocks!</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>but since it’s documented it’s considered a feature, not a bug to fix.</p>

<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> discovered a bug to do
with translating sound to text that shows itself in some cases (it works in
others) when working on his winning <a href="2020/ferguson2/prog.c">2020 Enigma machine</a>
(‘Most enigmatic’) entry. See his <a href="2020/ferguson2/index.html">index.html</a> for
details (search for <code>vik</code> in the file). This one might be more of a limitation
but this is not known.</p>
<p>He provides a tip in testing the problem: it might help to use his Enigma
machine to find problems as it will allow you to verify what is correct and what
is not. Again see his index.html for details. However it is also possible to not
rely on the entry as the below shows. One should be able to do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb80"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb80-1"><a href="#cb80-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">echo</span> <span class="st">&#39;No. I want chocolate!&#39;</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="ex">./prog</span> <span class="op">&gt;</span> chocolate.raw</span>

<p>and get:</p>
<pre><code>No. I want some chocolate!</code></pre>
<p>but instead we get:</p>
<pre><code>IT FHOCOLITE!</code></pre>
<p>which is very wrong. If however one does:</p>
<pre><code>echo IOCCC | ./prog &gt; ioccc.raw

./prog e &lt; ioccc.raw</code></pre>
<p>they will properly get:</p>
<pre><code>IOCCC</code></pre>

<li><p>The platform must implement the <code>double</code> type as IEEE754-compliant 64-bit
floating point numbers. The 80-bit intermediate format used by x87 is

uncertain if it should be.</p>
<p>The author also stated:</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>While the program works best when bytes/characters are octets and the
number of bits in a type is <code>sizeof(typ) &lt;&lt; 3</code>, it will work correctly
on 24-bit or 36-bit systems with 9 bits/byte, or systems where
<code>sizeof(typ)</code> is 1 even for <code>int</code> and so on. On such systems, it will only
use <code>8 * sizeof(typ)</code> bits per place. It does not work when <code>CHAR_BIT &lt;= 7</code>.</p>

<li>There is no error checking done when opening files, so expect segfaults if you

<li>This program is bound to misbehave if <code>int</code> is less than 32 bits.</li>
<li>Flags will only be interpreted correctly if they are the first argument. Reading
a file named <code>-d</code> or <code>-h</code> is fully possible if it is not the first file
provided, even though I am not sure why you would want to do that.</li>
<li>Providing invalid/unexpected arguments to the decode flag will result in odd
behavior. Some erroneous arguments cause segfaults (negative number of channels,
channel id outside valid range). One argument in particular causes an infinite

<p>The author wrote the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Despite appearances, it does not handle numbers in hex, or provide
a <code>curses(3)</code>-based interface.</p></li>
<li><p>The expected input format is zero or more lines of space-separated
integers. If other characters appear in the input, it will either
reject the input entirely and exit with a non-zero status, or skip
number(s) adjacent to the non-digit characters, depending on where the
characters appear. Tabs and multiple consecutive spaces are handled
correctly, however.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual lines of input longer than <code>0x3543 - 1</code> bytes will be
split and processed as if they were multiple lines of input, which can
produce incorrect results. This magic number’s significance is
described earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The algorithm expects its input to represent a fully connected graph.
While the output is otherwise topologically sorted, if there are nodes
completely unconnected to the rest of the graph (with or without
self-cycles), they will be output as soon as they are processed –
this means that, when there are disconnected nodes, reordering the
input lines can produce different output. Addressing this by adding
another pass is would put the program over the size limit.</p></li>
<li><p>While the node IDs don’t need to be consecutive or start at 0, the
implementation doesn’t have special handling for sparse graphs. If you
give it a graph with nodes numbered 0 and 2147483647, it will attempt
to allocate sufficient memory (potentially around 32 GB) for the
entire range of graph nodes, even if those are the only ones. If
memory allocation returns NULL, it will gracefully exit, otherwise it
will succeed, eventually, perhaps after a great deal of swapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Node IDs &gt;= 2147483648 will cause the program to print an error
message and exit with a non-zero status. This shrinks the code that
detects overflowing the array size by a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>A very large group of nodes in a cycle can cause a stack overflow.
This typically takes over 100,000 nodes, and depends on the order the
nodes are visited. Addressing this would put the program over the size
limit.</p></li>
<li><p>The implementation depends on the characters <code>'0'</code>, <code>'1'</code>, … <code>'9'</code> having
the values <code>48</code> through <code>57</code>, rather than using <code>isdigit(3)</code>. As noted above,
this program has nothing to do with a hand.</p></li>

<p><a href="authors.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson">Cody Boone Ferguson</a> fixed the scripts so
that they can work but it might end up that the scripts don’t show any output
anyway as they use the full alphabet. To test that it works one can have a
script like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb87"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb87-1"><a href="#cb87-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">LC_ALL</span><span class="op">=</span>C  <span class="ex">aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz</span> <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="va">LC_ALL</span><span class="op">=</span>C <span class="fu">grep</span> .. <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="va">LC_ALL</span><span class="op">=</span>de_DE.UTF-8 <span class="ex">./prog</span> aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you run this you should see:</p>
<pre><code>aäbcdefghijklmnoöpqrsßtuüvwxyz</code></pre>
<p>which shows it works. However as the de.sh script refers to all letters it can’t
find a perfect pangram. BTW, as far as the question of whether the umlaut
letters or the Eszett are considered letters in the German alphabet, Cody noted
in the de.sh/de.alt.sh scripts:</p>
<pre><code># Are the umlauts ä, ö, ü and Eszett (ß) letters in the German alphabet? There
# is more than one opinion on the subject but a lot of words do have an umlaut
# (or Umlaut in German). In some (probably all) systems this script outputs
# nothing probably because it&#39;s very hard to form a perfect pangram in German,
# if it&#39;s not impossible. Nevertheless, we do include the other characters
# whether or not they are in your view considered part of the alphabet for the
# reason that so many words have them.</code></pre>

<p>There are two things to be aware of with this entry.</p>
<p>If the file being used (to draw) is deleted it might lock any session still in

<p>This is NOT a bug and you’ll have to (at least at this time?) delete the files
manually. You shouldn’t have to worry about these being added to git: it seems

<p>The author noted that if the program runs out of memory it is likely to crash.</p>
<p>The author also stated that ‘if input contains CR-LF end of line sequences,
those <code>CR</code>s are silently dropped. In fact, most control codes are silently
ignored except line feeds (preserved) and tabs (expanded to 8 spaces).’</p>

<p>This entry is known to crash if no arg is specified. Although easy to fix it is
documented and should not be fixed (of course you may fix it to see if you can
but it shouldn’t be made into a pull request).</p>
<p>It will also show funny output with more than one arg. This should not be fixed
either. But can you figure out why this happens?</p>

<p>The author stated that bad things happen if the entered move is outside of the
range [1..9]. We observed a crash but we also observed a tie and other things
besides (say with the input <code>-1</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>-10</code> and others).</p>
<p>If a player makes a move over their opponent’s place they will automatically
lose.</p>
<p>If a player tries to play a move they already played they will forfeit their
move.</p>
<p>If you have audible bells enabled the program will beep at every turn.</p>

<p>The author listed the following limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The program does not support MIDI files over 4 MB (specifically, it will
not take input files larger than <code>2^22 - 1</code> bytes). This is unlikely to be a
big limitation in practice, since even lengthy MIDIs are rarely over a
couple hundred KB.</p></li>
<li><p>Not all MIDIs set (or <em>correctly</em> set) their timing information, which will
lead to the tempo of the drum beat not matching the track. This will be
especially true for “live performance” .mid files.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be some types of MIDI messages that the program is unable to
correctly parse, but I have rarely seen this in practice. The largest
cause of program failures, in my experience, has been Limitation 2.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We hope this document was of use to you in determining which entries are known
to have a problem, what entries are known to have features that are not bugs and
so on. We also thank you for going through this document and, if you propose any
fixes] via a <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/pulls">GitHub pull
request</a> or otherwise, we
thank you as well for the help! We will happily add you to the
