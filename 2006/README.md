# Nineteenth International Obfuscated C Code Contest


## Standard IOCCC stuff

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.

This year we included most of the information included by the submitters
in the `README.md` files (that were used to build the `index.html` web pages).

The IOCCC has a website and now has a number of international mirrors.
The primary website can be found at [www.ioccc.org](https://www.ioccc.org).


## Remarks on some of the entries

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

+ depended too much on non-portable side effects in expressions;

+ depended too much on a particular byte order;

+ required the use of a special script, data file or pseudo-machine
  language that was not supplied with the entry.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winning entries. The Best
of Show is a fine example of (retro) obfuscation.  But don't ignore the other
entries!  There are games, puzzles, puzzle solvers, simulators, emulators,
calculators and graphical and audio tools.

This year a single person won three awards and another two awards!  Many
authors won for the first time this year. (Please note that judging is done completely
anonymously.  Be warned that we may disqualify entries that reveal the identity
of the submitter).


## Final Comments

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: See [contact.html](../contact.html) for up to date contact details
as well as details on how to provide fixes to any of the entries.
