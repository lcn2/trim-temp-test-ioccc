REQUIREMENT:    This   facility  is  required  to  increase   the 
capability  to test,  evaluate,  and improve avinics systems  and 
reduce  flight  testing costs.   Rapid advances in avionics  have 
caused an increasing need for sophisticated avionics ground  test 
and  evaluation  facilities to support aircraft  avionic  systems 
flight test programs.

CURRENT SITUATION:    The existing facility has the capability to 
support four independent avionics intensive flight test programs.  
This facility is already being utilized to its maximum  capacity.  
Additional  programs  scheduled for flight test at Edwards  which 
have extensive avionics will include the F-15 Radar,  the HH-60D, 
and the EX program.
     The  existing facility was planned with sufficient space  in 
the  time  shared  computer complex to  house  additional  shared 
computer  capability.   Thus the new facility would only  require 
space for test bays.

IMPACT  IF  NOT PROVIDED:   Future avionics flight test  programs 
would  not be adequately supported,  resulting in costly  program 
delays,  inefficient  use of expensive flying time,  and the need 
for Air Force funding of contractor off-base facilities which are  
tailored to contractor development rather than combined airforce- 
contractor flight test objectives.

ADDITIONAL:  The test mode required in the absence of an avionics 
test  facility includes development and integration at contractor 
facilities,  limited flight test support atthe test  sites,remote 
flight  test  support from contractor  facilities,  and  airborne 
trouble  shooting (fly-fix-fly) which provides a  fragmented  and 
inadequate Air Force evaluation of the avionics.

The  increasing  complexity of the avionics in  our  current  and 
future  aerospace vehicles has outdated the traditional test sup
port  techniques.   Avionic capabilities continue to  expand  and 
take  on new roles.   Digital integration of fire and flight con
trol  systems  is under development.   Voice  operated  fire  and 
flight control is being evaluated.  Modern aircraft contain large 
numbers of independent computers, sensors, displays, and controls 
linked into a mutually dependent system.   The quantity, complex
ity,  and  pervasiveness of avionics is increasing at an exponen
tial rate.   Test and evaluation of the complex performance char
acteristics of the avionics requires the collection of quantities 
of data involving numerous parameters too extensive for practical 
manual  analysis and too diverse to be economically  solved  with 
"fly-fix-fly".   In  addition,  limited time in service and  high 
failure  rate of development hardware contribute to the need  for 
increased  ground and airborne testing.   In view of these  added 
requirements,  cost and schedule constraints dictate the need for 
additional  ground T&E and simulation to insure effective use  of 
expensive flight testing.  This facility and project will support 
future  programs  such as the new F-15 Radar,  the  HH-60D  Heli
copter,   the  JVX  tilt wing program,  the  Advanced  Technology 
Bomber,  the  Advanced Technology Fighter,  the New Fighter  Air
craft,  the EX (EC-135 replacement),  and the Integrated Inertial 
Reference Assembly.
