

     MAGE.COM is an 8080 assembly language program
which retrieves files accidentally lost while using
WORDSTAR.  The program captures an image of your 
file from computer memory and saves it on a floppy 
disk.

     MAGE can help with problems such as accidental 
resets, resets caused by static discharge, power 
fluctuations, bad sectors on floppy disks, write-
protected disks, full disks, BDOS errors on disks 
and various WORDSTAR glitches.  The program will 
not recover a file after a complete power outage 
nor under circumstances where you cannot reset the 
computer.  It can recover only that portion of a 
file which is in computer memory at the time of the 
accident.

     The first step in running this program is to 
hit the reset button on the front panel.  Contrary
to the Osborne 01 User's Reference Guide, this does
not initialize computer memory.  The file from 
WORDSTAR will remain intact in memory.

     Next, insert the floppy containing MAGE.COM
into one of the disk drives.  Boot the system.

     Running the program is as simple as typing
"MAGE filenam", where "filenam" is the name you 
want your file to be saved under.  If you do not 
specify a name, your file will be saved under the 
default name " . ".

     When you execute MAGE your file will begin 
listing to the screen almost immediately.  The 
program will stop automatically shortly after the 
last of the recoverable textual material has been 
reached.  A small amount of empty memory will also 
be copied at the bottom of your file.  Use WORDSTAR 
to remove these "nulls".

     As an alternative, MAGE constantly checks for
keyboard input.  By depressing any key you may halt 
program execution.  Only the portion of memory al-
ready listed to the screen will be saved to disk.
