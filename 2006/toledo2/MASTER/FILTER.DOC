This program copies any ASCII file and filters out (ignores)
all control characters except CR, LF, and TAB.  It also sets
the high order bit of all characters to zero so that files
created with WordStar or other text processing programs can
be read by MBASIC.  The filtered copy of the of the file is
created as 'FILTER.FIL' on the default drive.  The source
file is left intact.  If the original file's EOF (1AH) is
not at the physical end of the last sector, this program
will pad the last sector with EOF's.  This is useful for
'cleaning up' a file which was originally created by MBASIC
or text editors which do not pad the last sector with EOF's.
