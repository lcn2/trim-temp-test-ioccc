
Using Micro Sphere's Ram Disk with the PRO8 version 3


The ROM contains code to treat the Ram Disk as any other disk drive.
It allows you to use the screen dump with or without the the ram disk
attatched. Before accessing the ram disk you must have a 63K system.
Run RCONFIG.COM. When asked if you want to install a new bios answer
yes. The bios contains the necessary code to allow the Ram Disk and
drive A: to be swapped. RCONFIG allows you to choose any letter for
the ram disk and the swap drive letter.

Also select the correct ram disk size for your particular ram disk.
Exit the program and press the reset button. Your warm boot sign on
will now reflect the status of the ram disk. It will always say 'Off'
until you access the ram disk. If the ram disk is not connected or
not working, you will get a BDOS error SELECT. If it is alive you will
log on to the ram disk. The ram disk is the drive you chose in the
configuration program unless you swap it with drive A: by entering the
letter you chose for the swap code. At this point your ram disk becomes
drive A: and floppy drive A: can be accessed by using the letter you
assigned the ram disk. Entering the swap code a second time reverses
this procedure.

If you don't want the new bios (because you are running Plu Perfect or
some other enhanced bios) you can still use the Ram Disk code in ROM.
First run RCONFIG but do not install the new bios. Just set the ram disk
size and write it to disk. To access the Ram Disk after a reset, you must
first enter an ESC H to wake it up. It will then be available as drive
E: only. 

The printer buffer on the ram disk won't work until you access the ram
disk first.

RAM DISK COMMANDS:

ESC P	pause the ram disk printer buffer (stop printing until another ESC P)
ESC H	halt the ram disk printer buffer (stop printing and clear buffer)
