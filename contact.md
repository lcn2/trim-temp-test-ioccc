# WAIT!!! - Before you send that Email

If you are trying to:

* Fix a winning IOCCC entry - (see [FAQ 5.2](faq.html#fix_an_entry))
* Update winning author information - (see [FAQ 5.5](faq.html#fix_author))
* Correct a web site problem - (see [FAQ 5.4](faq.html#fix_web_site) or [FAQ 5.6](faq.html#fix_link))

Instead of sending us Email, **Please** consider using the [GitHub
pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

If you are trying to:

* Report a bug in an IOCCC winning entry - (see [FAQ 5.1](faq.html#report_bug))
* Report an IOCCC web site problem - (see [FAQ 5.3](faq.html#report_web_problem))
* Report a broken or wrong web link - (see [FAQ 5.6](faq.html#fix_link))

Instead first look at the [IOCCC
issues](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues) to see if the
problem has already been reported.  If it has been reported, feel
free to add a comment to the issue.  If you do not find an it has
been reported, then fee free to open a [new IOCCC
issue](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues).

See the above FAQ entries for more details.


# Try mastodon

You may wish to follow us [IOCCC on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
as we use that platform to announce things such as the opening of a new IOCCC
as well as winning entries of the IOCCC.

We no longer tweet (or whatever someone with poor impulse control calls
posting messages on their platform), preferring to reside in the [fediverse](https://fediverse.info) instead.

There is [help with Mastodon](https://mastodon.help) available for
those who might wish to [get started with Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/deck/getting-started).

While there are many fine Mastodon server instances out there, the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html)
use [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/about) where lots of fun folk hang out,
and topics like science, technology, [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
have a good home.  The [fosstodon.oeg](https://fosstodon.org/@fosstodon) folk made the IOCCC feel welcome.
And while using Mastodon is free, the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) are pleased to
[support the Fosstodon Hub](https://hub.fosstodon.org/support/).
