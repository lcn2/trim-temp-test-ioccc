# WAIT!!! - Before you send that email

If you are trying to:

* **Fix a winning IOCCC entry** - See
FAQ on "[fix entry](faq.html#fix_an_entry)"
* **Update winning author information** - See
FAQ on "[fixing author information](faq.html#fix_author)"
* **Correct a website problem** - See
FAQ on "[fixing the website](faq.html#fix_web_site)"
or
FAQ on "[fix URL](faq.html#fix_link)"

Instead of sending us email, **Please** consider using the [GitHub
pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process
against the [master branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

If you are trying to:

* **Report a bug in an IOCCC winning entry** - See
FAQ on "[report entry bug](faq.html#report_bug)"
* **Report an IOCCC website problem** - See
FAQ on "[report website problem](faq.html#report_web_problem)"
* **Report a broken or wrong web link** - See
FAQ on "[report broken link](faq.html#fix_link)"

In general, unless you have a fix, if you want to report something, you should instead first look at the [IOCCC
issues](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues) to see if the
problem has already been reported.  If it has been reported, feel
free to add a comment to the issue.  Otherwise, if you do not see the same issue
reported, then feel free to [open a new IOCCC
issue](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues/new).

If you are trying to:

* **Comment or make a suggestion on IOCCC rules** - See
FAQ on "[rules feedback](faq.html#feedback)"
* **Comment or make a suggestion on IOCCC guidelines** - See

and suggestion in the relevant places.
