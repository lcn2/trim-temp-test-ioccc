# WAIT!!! - Before you send that Email

If you are trying to:

* Fix a winning IOCCC entry - (see [FAQ 5.2](/faq.md#fix_an_entry))
* Update winning author information - (see [FAQ 5.5](/faq.md#fix_author))
* Correct a web site problem - (see [FAQ 5.4](/faw.md#fix_web_site) or [FAQ 5.6](/faq.md#fix_link))

Instead of sending us Email, **Please** consider using the [GitHub
pull request](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/pulls) process
against the master [branch](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/branches)
of the [ioccc-src/winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner).

If you are trying to:

* Report a bug in an IOCCC winner - (see [FAQ 5.1](/faq.md#report_bug))
* Report an IOCCC web site problem - (see [FAQ 5.3](/faq.md#report_web_problem))
* Report a broken or wrong web link - (see [FAQ 5.6](/faq.md#fix_link))

Instead first look at the [IOCCC
issues](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues) to see if the
problem has already been reported.  If it has been reported, feel
free to add a comment to the issue.  If you do not find an it has
been reported, then fee free to open a [new IOCCC
issue](//github.com/ioccc-src/winner/issues).

See the above FAQ entries for more details.
