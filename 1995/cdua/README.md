## To build:

        make all

[Cody Boone Ferguson](/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) fixed this so that it
would work with macOS. Once it could compile it additionally segfaulted under
macOS which he also fixed. Thank you Cody for your assistance!


## To run

	./cdua

NOTE: on modern systems this might be hard to see it solve it in running time as
it goes so quickly but it will still show the result after execution.

NOTE: sometimes the program needs you to press enter a second time to continue
solving the maze.


## Judges' comments

This could be used as the basis of an a-maze-ing screen exerciser.

## Author's comments

A program that generates a maze, and then solves it, all this being
seen by the user.  Some highlights of obfuscation are: 3 steps
functions in one - main(), several recursive calls with conditional
actions, and just one (big and ugly) statement to solve the maze.
