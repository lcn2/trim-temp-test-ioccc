# Twelfth International Obfuscated C Code Contest

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile and run the winning program.  Look at the winning source and
try to figure how it does what it does! You may then wish to look at the
`Author's remarks` section for even more details.

The IOCCC has an official home page, [www.ioccc.org](https://www.ioccc.org), which contains
previous winning entries, information about the judges, announcements and much
more.

Use `make` to compile entries.  It is possible that on BSD or non-Unix
systems the `Makefile` needs to be changed.  See the `Makefile` for details.

Read over the `Makefile` for compile/build issues.  Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
`#define` i.e. the `-D` flag).

This year [Sriram Srinivasan](http://www.malhar.net/sriram/) joined the judging.

The moderator of
[comp.unix.wizards](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.unix.wizards) did not feel
that the IOCCC was "wizardly" enough to be posted to comp.unix.wizards so we will
no longer post the winning entries to this newsgroup - we'll let you the reader decide
for yourself the wizardry of these entries.

This year there were several people who won more than once and several [previous
winning entries](../authors.html) as well. The judging was done without knowledge of the
names of the submitters - multiple winning entries were a coincidence. Since we tend to
discount entries that are similar to previous entries, these people had to come
with original ideas to stay in the winning entry circle.

We wish to thank [CAIP at Rutgers
University](https://catalogs.rutgers.edu/generated/nb-grad_0305/pg20199.html)
for the use of their machines.

## A few notes regarding future contests

Due to changes in the [USENIX
conference](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/all) calendar, the [1996
contest](../years.html#1996) will be delayed.  Because there will be no Summer
1996 USENIX conference, the 1996 IOCCC entries will be announced at the Jan 1997
USENIX conference.

The 1996 contest will not open until sometime in October 1996, and will close
sometime around the end of December 1996.  The [rules for the 1996
contest](../1996/rules.txt) have not been formed at this time and are not expected
to be ready for distribution until late September 1996.

Be sure to wait until the [1996 rules](../1996/rules.txt) are posted before
submitting entries.  Rules differ from year to year, sometimes in significant
ways.
