The obfuscation is on several levels.

Most obviously, the shape of the program.

Underneath that, the variable names are in pig latin, as are the
names of the standard C functions, such as putchar.  Even main is
written as ainma.

The program construction is also very obfuscated, with all of the
code being inside the ()'s of one of the 6 "orfa" loops.
