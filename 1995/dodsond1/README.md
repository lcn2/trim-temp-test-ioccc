	 the time because males are biologically driven to go out and hunt
	 giraffes.

## Author's remarks:

Istha ogrampra akesta Englishwa extta aswa inputwa andwa
anslatestra itwa intowa Igpa Atinla.

The obfuscation is on several levels.

Most obviously, the shape of the program.

Underneath that, the variable names are in pig Latin, as are the
names of the standard C functions, such as putchar.  Even main is
written as `ainma`.

The program construction is also very obfuscated, with all of the
code being inside the ()'s of one of the 6 `orfa` loops.
