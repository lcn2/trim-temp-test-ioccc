# Best One Liner:

    Mark Schnitzius
    ISX Corporation
    3215-C Post Woods Dr.
    Atlanta, GA 30339 
    USA

## To build:

        make all

## To run:

	./schnitzi num

## Try:
	./schnitzi 24
	./schnitzi 18
	./schnitzi 30

NOTE: as the author warns do not use too high a number! If you wish to ignore
the warning it is an exercise to determine how high is too high. :-)

## Judges' comments:

Sometimes a core dump is a feature, not a bug!

This is one of the better one-liners we have seen in a while.
Take some time to figure out what it does before you run it!

## Author's comments

Beware, running this program with too high of a number
amounts to doing a fork bomb on your machine!
