WARNING: the author warns to not use too high a number! If you wish to ignore
the warning it is an exercise to determine how high is too high. :-)


## Judges' remarks:

Sometimes a core dump is a feature, not a bug!

This is one of the better one-liners we have seen in a while.
Take some time to figure out what it does before you run it!


## Author's remarks:

Beware, running this program with too high of a number
amounts to doing a fork bomb on your machine!
