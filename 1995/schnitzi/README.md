## Judges' comments

    Sometimes a core dump is a feature, not a bug!

    This is one of the better one-liners we have seen in a while.
    Take some time to figure out what it does before you run it!

## Author's comments

    Beware, running this program with too high of a number
    amounts to doing a fork bomb on your machine!
