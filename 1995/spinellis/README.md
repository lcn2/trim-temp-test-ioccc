## To build:

## To use:

## Judges' remarks:

While the code does not abuse the rules, its output surely does!

P.S. Does the source have any spelling errors?


## Author's remarks:

96% of the program lines (631 out of the 658) are comment text rendering
the program readable and understandable.  With the exception of the
two include file names (needed for a warning-free compile) the program
passes the standard Unix spell checker without any errors.  Checking
for spelling errors is considered very important for programs that are
so heavily commented.  This program is exactly 3217 characters long
through judicious use of white space.  Rule abuse?  Would I _ever_ abuse
the rules?
