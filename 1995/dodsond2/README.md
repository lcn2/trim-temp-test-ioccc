## Author's remarks:

### Interactive 3D Maze

Step into a randomly generated 3D maze and try to get out alive!
Use the vi movement keys (hjkl) to move on a level, and u or d
to move (u)p or (d)own from a position with a U or D on the
map.  To simulate the feeling of being in an unknown labyrinth,
areas which you have not visited cannot be seen.

Reach the north-west left corner of level 1 to exit.
