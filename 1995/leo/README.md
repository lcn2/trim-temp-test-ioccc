The current status of this entry is:

```
STATUS: known bug - please help us fix
```

For more detailed information see [1995 leo bugs](../../bugs.html#1995_leo).


## To use:

```sh
./leo [ deep ] [ right ] [ Variable ] [ cycle [ freq ] ]
```

See the author's information below on these details.


## Try:

```sh
./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

Press return after each image is drawn.

The variable names are element-ary.  If you find this confusing,
remember that it is nu-clear.  :-)

Some Ghostscripts/Postscript programs cleared the screen right after
the image is drawn, so we added element 106 which acts as an input
buffer.

To qualify for a category specially for yourself in the Geek code, find out all
the secret switches that the author doesn't divulge !  (All switches are single
characters on the command line - anything that's not a number is a candidate.)


## Author's remarks:

The usage is:

```sh
./leo [ deep ] [ right ] [ Variable ] [ cycle [ freq ] ]
```

where the first three are literal words, `cycle` is a positive integer (0 is
ignored), and `freq` is an integer (default = 0) that's supposed to be in the
range `0..100` (bigger values are allowed, however).  Invalid parameters and
options usually stop the command line parsing (not always but why?). The actual
position of the word options does not matter, so `./leo right Variable 1 70` is
equivalent to `./leo 0 0 0 1 Variable 70 right`, etc.

If `Variable` is used, `cycle` is almost ignored (see below) but has
to be present if you want to enter `freq` (and you usually do).

Some options to try (besides the obvious):

```sh
./leo 1 | cat - /dev/tty | gs -
```

This draws the basic pattern I invented in high school:

You take a big sheet of "arithmetic" paper and draw a line
of length 1 (between 2 crossings) at the center of the sheet:

```
				|
```

This makes 2 open ends (I think the notion of an "open end" doesn't
require explanations) in step 1. Now, until there are open ends in step N,
repeat: for each open end pretend it points north and draw 2 lines going
northwest and northeast from it to the nearest crossings. This needs to be
done "simultaneously" for all ends that are open at that moment.


Step 2:

```
                               \./
                                |
                               / \
```

Step 3:

```
                            __|   |__
                               \./
                                |
                            __ / \ __
                              |   |

```

Step 4:

```
                                .
                             \./ \./
                           \__|   |__/
                           /   \./   \
                                |
                           \__./ \.__/
                           /  |   |  \
                             / \./ \
```

Step 5:

```
			  ._|   .   |_.
			__|  \./ \./  |__
			   \__|   |__/
			__./   \./   \.__
			__I     |     I__
			   \__./ \.__/
			__./  |   |  \.__
			  |_./ \./ \._|
			    |       |

```

The lines marked by `I` show the places where "simultaneity" is significant.

Note that so far all the drawings represent valid structural formulas of some
organic substances.

step 1: ethane
step 2: 2,3-dimethylbutane
step 3: (2,5-dimethyl;3,4-isopropyl)-hexane
step 4 and 5: I don't know. Do you?

Step 6:

```
               \./     \./                 \./     \./
              ._|   .   |_.               ._|   .   |_.
           \__|  \./ \./  |__/         \__|  \./ \./  |__/
           /   \__|   |__/   \         /   \__|   |__/   \
           \__./   \./   \.__/         \__./   \./   \.__/
           X__|     |     |__X   or    <__|     |     |__>
           /   \__./ \.__/   \         /   \__./ \.__/   \
           \__./  |   |  \.__/         \__./  |   |  \.__/
           /  |_./ \./ \._|            /  |_./ \./ \._|
                |       |                   |       |
               / \     / \                 / \     / \

```

depending on the desired "hairiness". The original (paper-based)
algorithm was "hairy", but it didn't look as good on the screen.

The program cannot handle non-hairy mode 100% correctly - step 6 happens
to be

```
                                      |__
        ...__/                  ...__/
        ...  \                  ...  \.
        ...__/                  ...__/|__
        ...__Y  and step 7:     ...__Y
        ...  \                  ...  \
        ...__/                  ...__/
             \                       \.__
                                      |

```

and so on: the horizontal symmetry has been lost. That's why
the opening for step 1 is not a single line but a cross:

```
                                \./
                                / \
```

To watch it repeatedly (as a screen saver), use:

```sh
./leo 2 | cat - /dev/tty | gs -
```

The command line:

```sh
./leo Variable 1 | cat - /dev/tty | gs -
```

draws the same as above. Try:

```sh
./leo Variable 1 1 | cat - /dev/tty | gs -
```

What happened to the picture? Increase `freq` and watch the changes.

If `cycle` is more than 1, the program loops, allowing the user to
enjoy randomly changing patterns (the delay is 3 seconds),
but there is a secret switch to suppress looping: useful
if you want to pipe the output to a printer.

`uudecode` the spoiler below if you really want to know.

```
begin 664 spoiler1
M*%1H92!C;VQO;B J:7,J('1H92!S96-R970@<W=I=&-H("T@=&AE('-P86-E
=(&)E9F]R92!I="!I<R!N;W0@82!M:7-T86ME*0II

end
```

If `Variable` is used, the actual value of `cycle` doesn't matter,
as far as it is > 1. To figure out what difference
`cycle` makes when `Variable` is not used, try

```sh
./leo Variable 37 80 | cat - /dev/tty | gs -
```

and other values of `cycle`; smaller values usually require
smaller values of `freq` for the patterns to be non-trivial.

The options `deep` and `right` make the patterns to be drawn in different
manners. Try all the examples above with `deep` and with `right`.
What is the difference between them?

...There is a little flaw in the implementation of the algorithm,
and sometimes the patterns are not symmetrical when they ought to be
(the program needs to be slightly changed to expose the flaw,
otherwise it is hardly noticeable, if ever).

A quick and dirty fix (turned on by another secret switch)
makes the patterns symmetrical, but a little too HAIRY.

There is one more secret switch (it shall also remain nameless), and I don't
even want to explain what it does. You've been warned!
