## Judges' comments:

Big terminals with tiny fonts have their uses in certain cases.
One of them is:

```sh
./prog < prog.c > treacle.c
make treacle
./treacle
```

## Author's comments:

### Remarks

You may want to use a large display with a very small-font terminal.

### Spoiler

Decompress `src.zip` if you need explanation.
