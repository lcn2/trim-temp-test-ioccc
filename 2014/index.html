<h1 id="twenty-third-international-obfuscated-c-code-contest">Twenty
Third International Obfuscated C Code Contest</h1>
<h2 id="standard-ioccc-stuff">Standard IOCCC stuff</h2>
<p>View the <code>index.html</code> web page for the given winning entry
for information on how compile the entry and how to run the winning
program. Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what
it does! You may then wish to look at the Author’s remarks for even more
details.</p>
<p>The IOCCC has a web site and now has a number of international
mirrors. The primary site can be found at <a
href="https://www.ioccc.org">www.ioccc.org</a>.</p>
<p>Use make to compile entries. It is possible that on non-Unix /
non-Linux systems the Makefile needs to be changed. See the Makefile for
details.</p>
<p>Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and
run them with various inputs. If you want to, look at the hints files
for spoilers - this year we included most of the information included by
the submitter.</p>
<p>Read over the README.md for compile/build issues. Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
<code>#define</code>).</p>
<p>Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be. If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.</p>
<h2 id="remarks-on-some-of-the-entries">Remarks on some of the
entries</h2>
<p>We believe you will again be impressed with this year’s winning
entries.</p>
<p>This year, 2014:</p>
<p>We, the judges, were very surprised by this as many of the multiple
authors submitted very different styles of entries.</p>
<p>This year was the second time the IOCCC size tool was used. Rule 2
required that when program source is fed as input to the current IOCCC
size tool, and the IOCCC size tool <code>-i</code> command line option
is used, the value printed should be less than or equal to 2053.</p>
<p>We were pleased to see that abuse of the rules was extended to abuse
to the IOCCC size tool. <a href="../authors.html#Matt_Zucker">Matt
Zucker</a>, followed by a few users, were able to discover clever use of
certain <code>//</code> comments to perplex the size tool. The abuse was
so bad that the judges released a critical and mandatory patch to the
IOCCC size tool on 2014-09-23.</p>
<p>There were some great entries that did not win. Unfortunately some
entries lost because they:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>were too large according the IOCCC size tool and didn’t even
attempt to justify their excess by a clever abuse of the rules</p></li>
<li><p>depended on a single obfuscation trick</p></li>
<li><p>didn’t work as documented</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.</p>
<p>There is a risk in submitting an entry that is similar to a well used
theme by previous winning entries. Previous authors set a very high bar.
A new winning entry must not only compete against submissions from the
current year, they must also excel over any similar entries in some
particularly impressive way.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-delay-in-releasing-the-winning-entries">On the delay in
releasing the winning entries</h2>
<p>We apologize on the delay of sending the authors the tarball for them
to review. There were some unforeseen events, such as unplanned
mandatory business travel, the death of an IOCCC judge’s mother, etc.
that impacted our planned schedule for building the tarball of this
year’s winning entries.</p>
<p>During some of these forced delays, we took the time to better
automate some of the tools needed to package the source for the winning
entries to review and to post the edited entries to the web site. It is
our intent that these changes made during those delays will make
releasing future winning IOCCC entries a faster procedure.</p>
<p>p.s. The final advice given to Landon by his mom: “Have fun.” We
recommend following this advice where possible.</p>
<h2 id="final-comments">Final Comments</h2>
<p>Please feel free to send us comments and suggestions about the
competition, this README or anything else that you would like to see in
future contests.</p>
<p>If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please
drop us a line. We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is
used.</p>
<p>If you have problems with any of the entries, AND YOU HAVE A FIX,
please send us the fix (patch file or the entire changed file).</p>
