## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./prog [arg ..]
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

Think of this as a Maker Faire's make.  :-)

It works reasonably well.  While not super ultra-featured, it does fair well
with the Makefile we supplied.  Not only that, it helped uncover a bug we had in
our special Makefile rules.


## Author's remarks:

### Remarks

This program is a tiny `make(1)` clone.

It is able to parse a subset of the `make(1)` syntax and will execute rules for
goals given in arguments if they need to (based on timestamp of dependencies
of rule targets).


## Supported features

* Variable assignments (only recursive ones). Variable references with recursion.
* Environment variables are available.
* It is possible to specify variables in command line: `name=value`.
* Variables given in command line will have precedence over variables defined
  in Makefile, which will have precedence over environment variables.
* If no target given in command line, the first target defined will be used.
* Comments, escaped comments, escaped new lines.

It should be able to build programs of previous years with the provided `Makefile`
found in previous contest archives. Simply use this program instead of `make`.
It will recursively use itself for sub-make (the `MAKE=` assignment inside
`Makefile` will be ignored to continue using itself).


## Limitations / Known issues

* There are a lot of memory leaks (not a single free).
* The opened file is not closed.
* The input file shall be named `Makefile`.
* No diagnostic message, but the exit status is non zero to indicates failure
  (failed command in a rule or missing target).
* Only `$<` and `$@` are supported for automatic variables in commands.
* No parallel execution (`-j` option).
* No `:=` `+=` `?=` syntax for variable assignment.
* No built-in function available.
* No pattern targets.
* No pattern substitution variables.
* No built-in rules.
* No built-in variables (except the one from environment).
* No conditional directives.
