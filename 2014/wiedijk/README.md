## To build:

```sh
make
```


## To use:

```sh
./prog
```


## Try:

```sh
./try.sh
```

By default that will use `indent(1)` found by the shell `type -P indent` and
`sed(1)` found by the shell `type -P sed` but if you want to change these, say
to try a different beautifier, you can do it like:

```sh
INDENT=bcpp ./try.sh
```

which would change it to use `bcpp(1)` instead of `indent(1)`. Do similar for
`sed(1)` only use the name `SED`.

C11 features definitely help this entry to be as concise as it is.

The judges would like to think that they had almost understood how this entry works.

## Author's remarks:

### Remarks

- Computes the factorial function.
- No loops, no explicit recursion.
- Untyped C without any casts, using a `w` word datatype.
- Varargs not essential, `w(*)(w,w*)` works just as well.
- Conforming to ISO C.
- No warnings when compiled with `-std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic`.
- Comments in the code explain what this really is about.
- C as a functional programming language: untyped lambda calculus compiled to
executable C functions.
- Untagged closures (just a function pointer followed by some values).
- Recursion implemented through Curry's paradoxical combinator `Y`.
- The readable implementation of `Y` is on lines 29-30:

```
W_f = \x.f(xx)
Y = \f.W_f W_f
```

- A mixture of strict and lazy evaluation, with a `_` force function
  (John Tromp notes that if Turing's fixed-point combinator
  `(\xy.y\z.xxyz)(\xy.y\z.xxyz)` had been used,
  all applications could have been strict).
- Uses `Y` to implement factorial on native `int`s.
- 10! seconds = 6 weeks.
- Answers the [ultimate question of life, the universe and
everything](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42).
