## Judges' remarks:

At this point you might be wondering, [WTF](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/WTF)?\*

* What The Freak (polite form)

* What's This For? (you may be wondering)

* What the Fish (python form)

How is this code obfuscated?  Well look again:

```sh
less prog.c

more prog.c
```

Where did those underscores come from?  Well [RTFS](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/RTFS)!\*\*

** Read the Freaking Source (polite form)
** Read The Freaking Screen (polite form)

If you are still puzzled, look at [prog.c](prog.c) with your favorite text editor.


## Author's remarks:

**Follow these instructions literally!**

```sh
cat prog.c
gcc -w -o prog prog.c
./prog
```

You will do a double take.

Hint 1: Do `less prog.c`.  You will see an **emphasized** string if your
terminal supports bold.

Hint 2: Do `wc -c prog.c`.  This is very long one-liner.

Spoiler: Open the source with an editor like `vim` or `emacs`.
