## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make
```


## To use:

```<!---sh-->
    make -B [MACHINE=your_machine.h] [TAPE=your_tape.h] [X=[0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9]] [V=[0|1|2]] run
```


## Try:

```<!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

This is something we were fearing all along: that the C preprocessor is Turing-complete
even without conditionals and recursive file inclusion as some kind of a
[rewriting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting). Now we have the proof!


## Author's remarks:

### Preprocessor Turing Engine

### Features

- Turing machine runs in preprocessor
- universal (unlimited configurable states, symbols, and tape)
- no `#if`s or other conditional directives, only `#define`s
- no recursive `#include`
- single compiler run (no repeated preprocessing)
- no variadic macros
- verbosity levels:
  + `V=0` (default) only prints the final tape
  + `V=1` additionally prints one tilde character per machine step (slow)
  + `V=2` additionally prints details on each machine step (slow; generates large files)
- make target `run` runs `./prog` and filters a little statistics out of the verbose output
- `X` (defaults to 3) sets the maximum number of steps: *M*(`X`) ~ 8<sup>`X`</sup>


### Limitations

If the machine does not halt after *M*(`X`) steps, you will see unexpanded
macros in the output.


### Compiler warnings

If `V=1` or `V=2` is used, you may see "`warning: string length is greater than
the length '4095' ISO C99 compilers are required to support`".


### Programming

Implementing your own Turing machine is easy. Take a look at the supplied header
files for examples.


#### Tape Symbols

Every symbol used (except `_`) must be explicitly declared using

```<!---c-->
    #define sym_SYMBOL(sym, _SYMBOL) sym
```

Example:

```<!---c-->
    #define sym_1(sym, _1) sym
```


#### Tape

The initial content of the tape must be defined in the tape header using a
triple like:

```<!---c-->
    #define tape ((((,),...l2), l1), c, (r1, (r2..., (,))))
```

- `l1`, `l2`, ... are the symbols to the left
- `c` is the symbol at the current position
- `r1`, `r2`, ... are the symbols to the right

The empty pairs `(,)` represent the continuations of the tape, filled with
underscore symbols (`_`). They are expanded on demand.


#### State Machine

All transitions are defined in the machine header using the syntax

```
    #define CURRENT_SCANNED (WRITE, MOVEMENT, NEXT)
```

where

- `CURRENT` is the current state.
- `SCANNED` is the symbol at the current position.
- The whitespace before the parentheses is significant.
- `WRITE` is the symbol to be written to the tape.
- `MOVEMENT` is `L` for left, `R` for right; don't specify anything if you
want no movement.
- `NEXT` is the next state.

There must be a state `A` defined, which becomes the initial state of the
machine.

To halt the machine, use the keyword `break` as in

```<!---c-->
    #define A_1 (2, break)
```
