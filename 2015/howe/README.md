## To build:

```sh
    make
```

There is an alternate version provided. See [Alternate code](#alternate-code)
below.


## To use:

```sh
    ./prog file1 file2

    ./prog -d file1 file2
```


## Try:

```sh
    ./try.sh
```


## Alternate code:

This alternate version does not use a 64-bit FNV hash. This was the original
entry but was changed to be the alt version.


### Alternate build:

```sh
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `prog.alt` as you would `prog` above.


## Judges' remarks:

This is the best use of the FNV that we have seen in the IOCCC so far!
The output, when used without `-d`, is compatible with POSIX `diff(1)` and
is suitable for use with `patch(1)`.

Is this code a bug or a feature? :-)  Or is this an attempt to corrupt the
programming of our youth?  Should we heed Kyle's mom words that she uttered
during a South Park P.T.A. Meeting?

   "We must stop dirty (C) language from getting to our children's ears!"

Or should we teach our youth to understand the intricacies of this code?
Ying Tong Iddle I Po!  We suggest you read the source for yourself, which
might be easier than the academic papers it was inspired by.

NOTE: Unlike the original entry source, [prog.alt.c](prog.alt.c),
[prog.c](prog.c) uses a
64 bit FNV hash and fixes a function call warning.


## Author's remarks:

### Features

* "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm" by Wu, Manber, Myers, Miller.

* Output compatible with `patch(1)`.

* Strokes one of the judge's ego (I couldn't email chocolate or curry).


### Description

This is a functioning micro `diff(1)` tool using an [O(NP) algorithm][Wu+89],
compared to the older [O(ND) difference algorithm][Mye86] used by some versions
of `diff(1)`.  Its output is based on the default `diff(1)` output described by POSIX
and [the Open Group Base Specifications][SUSV7].  The output is suitable for use
with `patch(1)`.

The `-d` option simply writes the edit distance between `file1` and `file2`.


### Observations

The FNV1a hash is a little slow compared to the trivial hash [GNU
diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) uses. I downloaded a plain text
copy of "War And Peace" from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org),
used [makeholes.c](makeholes.c) to make 1000 random changes, then profiled and
timed the program verses GNU `diff(1)`.  The bottleneck appears to be in the
file I/O and line hashing with an average +0.05s slower.  Using a huge file like
"War And Peace" for testing offsets the `diff(1)` optimised file I/O.

There is no hash collision checking, partly because FNV1a appears to generate
very [few collisions][HshCmp] and an assumption that localised collisions within
a region of edits are highly unlikely.


### Support Files

* [prog-test.sh](prog-test.sh)
    Basic test program verifies known test edit distances and `patch(1)` support.

* [avgtime.sh](avgtime.sh)

* [makeholes.c](makeholes.c)
    Random edits (holes) made to a file in-place.
