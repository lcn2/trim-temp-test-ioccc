## To build:

```sh
    make
```


There is an alt version which is the originally submitted entry. See [Alternate
code](#alternate-code) below for details.


## To use:

```sh
    ./prog <a number of arguments>
```


## Try:

```sh
    ./try.sh
```


## Alternate code:

An alternate version of this entry, [prog.alt.c](prog.alt.c), is provided.
This alternate code does not contain improvements suggested by [Gil
Dogon](../../authors.html#Gil_Dogon); it is the author's original entry.


### Alternate build:

```sh
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `prog.alt` as you would `prog` above.


## Judges' remarks:

For this one liner it is best to avoid prime numbers. The output groups
factors in the x-y dimensions. How many factors can be represented before you
run out of command line argument space? How could you modify the program to
experiment with numbers that have more or larger factors?


## Author's remarks:

Visual factorization 1-liner.  Try:

```sh
    gcc -o prog prog.c
    ./prog @
    ./prog @ @
    ./prog @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    ./prog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
```

Diagrams](http://www.datapointed.net/visualizations/math/factorization/animated-diagrams/).

[prog.alt.c](prog.alt.c) is the original version that I submitted. [Gil
Dogon](../../authors.html#Gil_Dogon) kindly improved it during the review.  Thank
you!
