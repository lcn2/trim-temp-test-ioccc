<h1 id="twenty-fourth-international-obfuscated-c-code-contest">Twenty
Fourth International Obfuscated C Code Contest</h1>
<h2 id="standard-ioccc-stuff">Standard IOCCC stuff</h2>
<p>The IOCCC has a web site and now has a number of international
mirrors. The primary site can be found at,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ioccc.org/">http://www.ioccc.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Use make to compile entries. It is possible that on non-Un*x /
non-Linux systems the makefile needs to be changed. See the Makefile for
details.</p>
<p>Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and
run them with various inputs. If you want to, look at the hints files
for spoilers - this year we included most of the information included by
the submitter.</p>
<p>Read over the makefile for compile/build issues. Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
#define).</p>
<p>Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be. If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.</p>
<h2 id="remarks-on-some-of-the-winners">Remarks on some of the
winners</h2>
<p>We believe you will again be impressed with this year’s winners.</p>
<p>The fraction of worthy entries was higher than usual.</p>
<p>We call to your attention, the <em>hou</em> entry, that performs the
MD5 cryptographic hash. Normally implemented with a set of integer and
boolean operations, this code uses floating point variables inside a
single while loop filled with unusual constants, cosine, square root,
and exponent function calls. The number of lines of code is also smaller
than the original algorithm.</p>
<p>The <em>mills2</em> source code is a very compressed version of a
decompression algorithm. We think those who enjoy compression algorithms
will particularly enjoy this entry.</p>
<p>We suggest that you attempt to completely understand the
<em>endoh4</em> 1-liner program: another impressive compact piece of C
code.</p>
<p>And while you are at it, cat the <em>endoh2</em> prog.c code. Compile
it and look at the source code again.</p>
<p>In a “Back to the Future” moment, <em>endoh3</em> gave us a twist on
one of the all time best IOCCC entries from 1984.</p>
<p>We also suggest that you take a very good look at how the
<em>muth</em> code makes full use of the C Pre-Processor.</p>
<p>…We’ll stop spouting spoilers now. Have fun exploring all the
entries!</p>
<h2 id="remarks-on-some-of-submissions-that-did-not-win">Remarks on some
of submissions that did not win</h2>
<p>The number of entries that would have made it into the final rounds
would have been much higher had some people paid attention to rules 2
and 22 (one third of 666).</p>
<p>Rule 22, now known as <strong>Catch 22</strong> states:</p>
<pre><code>|  22) Your source code, data files, remarks and program output must NOT
|      identify the authors of your code.  The judges STRONGLY prefer to
|      not know who is submitting entries to the IOCCC.

|      The &quot;Peter Honeyman is exempt&quot; guideline also applies to this rule.
|      Identifying yourself, in an obvious way in your code, data, remarks
|      or program output, unless you are Peter Honeyman or pretending
|      to be Peter Honeyman, will be grounds for disqualification of your entry.</code></pre>
<p>A number of other entries were based on iocccsize.c, making
derivative works rather than original works.</p>
<p>Still other entries were too large, violating the first line of rule
2:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The size of your program source must be &lt;= 4096 bytes in
length.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these entries might have passed under the 2053 limit for
iocccsize, they were larger than &lt;= 4096 bytes, sometimes by an order
or magnitude.</p>
<p>We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.</p>
<h2 id="final-comments">Final Comments</h2>
<p>Please feel free to send us comments and suggestions about the
competition, this README or anything else that you would like to see in
future contests.</p>
<p>If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please
drop us a line. We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is
used.</p>
<p>If you have problems with any of the entries, AND YOU HAVE A FIX,
please send us the fix (patch file or the entire changed file).</p>
