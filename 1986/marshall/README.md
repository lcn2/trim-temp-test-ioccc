## To build:

        make all


[Cody Boone Ferguson](/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) got this to
compile and work with clang. It did not work with clang because it is more
strict about the second and third args to main() and the third arg was an int.
He notes that he tried to keep the picture as close to the original. The line
lengths are the same but some spaces had to be changed to non-spaces. Thank you
Cody for your help!

## Try:

# Judges' comments:

This program prints the name of the picture.  The layout is somewhat
pretty though it is not the usual sort of output one would expect
from printing a program!

This program was selected for the 1987 t-shirt collection.
