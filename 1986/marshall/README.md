## To build:

        make all


NOTE: Cody Boone Ferguson got this to compile and work with clang. It did not
work with clang because it is more strict about the second and third args to
main() and the third arg was an int. He notes that he tried to keep the picture
as close to the original. The line lengths are the same but some spaces had to
be changed to non-spaces. Thank you Cody for your help!

# Judges' comments:

This program prints the name of the picture.  The layout is somewhat
pretty though it is not the usual sort of output one would expect
from printing a program!

This program was selected for the 1987 t-shirt collection.
