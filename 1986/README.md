# The 1986 contest was named "The Third International Obfuscated C Code Contest"


Look at the `README.md` file for the given winner for information
on how to compile the entry and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

The [rules for 1986](rules.txt) suggested categories due to the success of the
[1985](/years.html#1985)
judging method.  The maximum size was increased from 512 to 1024 bytes.
Larry Bassel joined as the second official judge.

A poll was taken for the worst code for
[BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) and [System
V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V) program.  The [Bourne
Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) (`/bin/sh`) won for both
systems.  The BSD [finger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol))
program took third place.

[Rules](rules.txt) and [results](/years.html#1986) were posted to
[net.lang.c](https://groups.google.com/g/net.lang.c) and
[net.unix-wizards](https://groups.google.com/g/net.unix-wizards).
[Micro/Systems
Journal](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?microsystemsjournal)
started regular publishing of the winners.  The practice of making first
announcement of the winners at the Summer Usenix BOF (Birds of a Feather)
started this year.  A notice was posted to net.announce.
