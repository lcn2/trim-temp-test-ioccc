## To build:

        make all


NOTE: On modern systems this entry requires the option `-traditional-cpp` which
clang does not support. Please be advised that gcc under macOS is actually
clang so this will not compile with the default gcc under macOS. As this entry
stood in modern systems it did not work even when compiled. We used a patch
provided by Yusuke Endoh to make it work. Thank you Yusuke!

## Judges' comments:

The original version did not have a ';' character in the first line.
This caused a number of System V C pre-preprocessors to gripe about a
syntax error.

This program is a masterpiece of obfuscation and humor.  Larry Wall
(the hacker who gave us rn and patch) asks you to compile and consider
the warning message generated by the C compiler.  Then execute the
program and type characters into its standard input.  You will see why
the compiler documents the program.
