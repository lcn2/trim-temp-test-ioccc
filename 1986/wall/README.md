# Grand prize in most well-rounded in confusion

## To build:

```sh
make all
```


## To use:

```sh
./wall
```

### Alternate code:

If you have an old compiler or a compiler that supports `-traditional-cpp` you
might enjoy looking at the original source in [wall.alt.c](wall.alt.c).


### Alternate build:

```sh
# if you have an old enough compiler:
make alt

# or if you have gcc:
make CC=gcc alt

# or if you have a compiler that supports -traditional-cpp that's not gcc:
make CFLAGS+="-traditional-cpp" alt
```

NOTE: gcc in macOS is actually clang even the binary `/usr/bin/gcc`.

Use `./wall.alt` as you would `./wall`.


## Judges' remarks:

The original version did not have a ';' character in the first line.
This caused a number of System V C pre-preprocessors to gripe about a
syntax error.

This program is a masterpiece of obfuscation and humor.  Larry Wall (the hacker
who gave us [rn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_(newsreader)) and
[patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(Unix))) asks you to compile and
consider the warning message generated by the C compiler.  Then execute the
program and type characters into its standard input.  You will see why the
compiler documents the program.
