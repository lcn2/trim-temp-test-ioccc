## To build:

        make all

NOTE: This entry uses non-standard args to main() that do not work with modern compilers.

## Judges' comments:

The original version did not have a ';' character in the first line.
This caused a number of System V C pre-preprocessors to gripe about a
syntax error.

This program is a masterpiece of obfuscation and humor.  Larry Wall
(the hacker who gave us rn and patch) asks you to compile and consider
the warning message generated by the C compiler.  Then execute the
program and type charters into its standard input.  You will see why
the compiler documents the program.

NOTE: This entry requires a non-standard K&R C compiler to compile.
