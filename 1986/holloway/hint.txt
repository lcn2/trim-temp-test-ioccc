## To build:

        make all

NOTE: This entry uses non-standard args to main() that do not work with modern compilers.

## Judges' comments:

Believe it or not, this is the old standard "Hello, world" program
performed in a very complex way.  The judges and the author defy you
do determine how it does it.  It is a good thing that K&R didn't use
this version as the first C program!

NOTE: This entry requires a non-standard K&R C compiler to compile.
