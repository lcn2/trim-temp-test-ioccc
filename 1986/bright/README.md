## To build:

## Judges' comments:

Compile this program and give a filename as an argument.

Mr. Bright exploits the C pre-processor, similar variables and
excessive shifting to obfuscate an otherwise useful binary display
program.  This gives you a small example of what it is like to
maintain the Bourne shell! :-}
