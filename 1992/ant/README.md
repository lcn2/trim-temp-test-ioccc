## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
```


The author provided us with an unobfuscated version. See [Alternate
code](#alternate-code) below.


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./ant Makefile

    ./ant Makefile rule
```

where `Makefile` is a Makefile to use and `rule` is an optional rule to use.


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```


## Alternate code:

This version, [ant.alt.c](%%REPO_URL%%/1992/ant/ant.alt.c), was provided by the
author in 2024, and is an unobfuscated version.


## Alternate build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make alt
```


## Alternate use:

Use `ant.alt` as you would `ant` above.


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.alt.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

Like much of POSIX, obfuscation has its place.  Your task is to
figure out where.

This entry comes complete with a POSIX-like command description.
Interested POSIX balloters should lobby the IEEE for an obfuscated
P1003 subcommittee.


## Author's remarks:

See the file [ant.README.txt](ant.README.txt).
