## Judges' comments


    Like much of Posix, obfuscation has its place.  Your task is to
    figure out where.

    This entry comes complete with a Posix-like command description.
    Interested Posix balloters should lobby the IEEE for an obfuscated 
    P1003 sub-committee.

    We also suggest that you try:

	make am
	./am Makefile am_clobber	# clobber everything except am
	./am Makefile all
