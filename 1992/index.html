<h1 id="ninth-international-obfuscated-c-code-contest">Ninth
International Obfuscated C Code Contest</h1>
<p>Look at the README.md file for the given winning entry for
information on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author’s remarks for even more
details.</p>
<p>Use <code>make</code> to compile entries. It is possible that on BSD
or non-Unix systems the Makefile needs to be changed. See the Makefile
for details.</p>
<p>Read over the Makefile for compile/build issues. Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
<code>#define</code> i.e. the <code>-D</code> flag). A number of
compilers had problems optimizing certain entries. Some compilers do
optimize, but the resulting program does not work. By default we have
left off <code>-O</code> from compile lines. You might want to add
<code>-O</code> back, or add it back for certain entries where
performance is important.</p>
<p>This year marked an all time high for number of entries as well as
the quality of entries. Nearly twice the usual number of entries made it
to the final judging rounds. Even when we raised the standards for
winning, we still wound up giving out a few more awards than in other
years. The new size rules size probably contributed to the overall high
quality.</p>
<p>FYI: By tradition, we do not record the count of the number entries,
nor do we give our our guess as to the number of entries received. For
folks who wonder, we can say that we consumed about 2000 pages of output
(printing between 2 and 4 normal pages per side) during the judging
process this year.</p>
<p>The new instructions for submitting entries worked well - we were
able to write scripts to unpack them and eliminate duplicates.</p>
<p>As promised last year, we accepted programs that made use of the X
libraries for the first time. We now consider ANSI C compilers to be the
“standard” version that the entries were compiled with.</p>
<p>Name and address information are separated from the actual program
prior to judging. This eliminates any chance that we would bias our
judging for/against any person or group. In the end, we are surprised as
you are to see who has won. Even so, it is worth noting that <a
href="https://www.ioccc.org/authors.html#Brian_Westley">Brian
Westley</a> has submitted a winning entry for the past 6 years!</p>
<h2 id="a-few-notes-regarding-future-contests">A few notes regarding
future contests:</h2>
<p>We did not give awards to some traditional contest categories such as
“Best Layout”. We felt that to do so would deny awards to more deserving
entries. These categories have not been eliminated. We will likely be
awarding them in future years.</p>
<p>We received a few entries whose instructions were rot13’d. While
nothing was said about this in the rules, we found that it made the
judging process a little harder, so we may request that this not be done
this in the future.</p>
<p>Some thought has been given to a separate obfuscated perl contest.
Watch comp.lang.perl for details!</p>
<p>Be sure to wait until the 1993 rules are posted before submitting
entries. We may fine tune the rules to reflect the some ideas above.</p>
<p>Please send us comments and suggestions what we have expressed above.
Also include anything else that you would like to see in future
contests. Send such email to:</p>

<p>If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please
drop us a line. We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is
used.</p>
