## Judges' remarks:

The program uses error messages issued by the C Preprocessor to
generate its message to the world.  One program's error is another
program's data!


## Author's remarks:

This program is yet another "Hello World." program with a twist.  The
string Hello World has been encoded in the error messages the compiler
generates when compiling the source.
