## To build:

## To use:

```sh
    ./marangon
```


## Judges' remarks:

The object is to refill the table with 5's, by incrementing or decrementing
numbers as needed.  It is the side effects that get you into trouble.  If you
are not careful, you may find things "at 6's and 7's".  :-)

NOTE: Some compilers have had trouble optimizing this entry.

NOTE: Some systems need to compile with `-ltermcap` as well as `-lcurses`.

NOTE: The original winning source [marangon.orig.c](marangon.orig.c), found in
the archive directory, assumed that `exit(3)` returns a value which cause
problems for some systems where `exit(3)` returns a `void`.  The file
[marangon.c](marangon.c) avoids this problem.


## Author's remarks:

It starts off by creating a table with number 5 in all places.  The CPU melts
the numbers and you must return them in original state.  When you increase a
number, all the other eight numbers next to it decrease and vice-versa.
