# try.sh - script to show IOCCC winner 1992/westley
#
# This script runs westley on a variety of locations to show different cities in
# the world, based on the author's remarks and the judges' remarks.
#
# This script will first try compiling the code and alt code (alt = US only with
# higher resolution, based on the author's remarks) and then if all is OK it
# will continue.
#
# The whereami.sh and whereami.alt.sh scripts correspond to westley.c and
# westley.alt.c but they check that the number of columns is at least 80. If
# it's not at least 80 then it's an error. The scripts can be deceived by doing
# something like:
#
#   COLUMNS=100 ./whereami.sh lat long
#
# even if the number of columns is < 80 but there's nothing that can be done
# about that.
#
# If westley or westley.alt cannot compile then it is an error and the script
# will exit.
#
# If by chance westley.sh or westley.alt.sh are not executable files then it
# will try chmod +x on them and then try again. Otherwise it'll just use westley
# and westley.alt.
#
# This script knows which version, the entry or alt code, to use based on what
# city is being shown (based on the author's remarks).
#
# Usage: ./try.sh
