# Seventeenth International Obfuscated C Code Contest


## Standard IOCCC stuff

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile the entry and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using `gcc` instead of your
local compiler.


## Remarks on some of the entries

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winning entries.  The [Best of
Show](gavin/index.html) is a fine example of obfuscation.  But don't ignore the
other entries!  There are games, utilities, programs that output images and a
one-liner that is incredibly compact for what it can do.

The [Best abuse of the guidelines](hibachi/index.html) is technically allowed by
the rules.  This year we allowed it due to the functionality of the program.
This entry is one of the easiest to read!  Don't assume you can win using
similar techniques next time ... :-)

This year a [single person](../authors.html#Daniel_Vik) won two awards!  We also
had repeat authors with their 6th, 4th and 2nd winning entries this year!
(Please note that judging is done completely anonymously.  Be warned that we may
disqualify entries that reveal the identity of the submitter.)

### Remarks on some losing entries

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

* depended too much on non-portable side effects in expressions; and/or
* depended too much on a particular byte order; and/or
* required the use of a special script, data file or pseudo-machine
  language that was not supplied with the entry.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.


## Final Comments

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: See [contact.html](../contact.html) for up to date contact details
as well as details on how to provide fixes to any of the entries.
