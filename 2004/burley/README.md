NOTE: you need to input a number first. See judges' remarks below for
information on how to play.


## Judges' remarks:

This is a [draw poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_poker) program.  You
start with $100.  Input alternates between your bet and which cards to keep.
Example:

```
5		<== you enter a bet of $5 (defaults to $1)
J Q J 9 5	<== your hand is Jack of Clubs, Queen of Hearts,
C H D S C	    Jack of Diamonds, 9 of Spades, 5 of Clubs
123		<== you enter which cards you want to keep
		    (enter 0 to 5 digits between 1 and 5)
J Q J J Q	<== your new hand is Jack of Clubs, Queen of Hearts,
C H D S C	    Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Spaces, Queen of clubs
$145 (45)	<== Your new balance is now $145.  You had a Full House
		    so your payoff is 9 times your bet == 45
```

The payout is according to "Vegas rules":

```
Straight Flush     50 times your bet
Four of a Kind     25 times your bet
Full House          9 times your bet
Flush               6 times your bet
Straight            4 times your bet
3 of a Kind         3 times your bet
2 Pair              2 times your bet
Jacks or Better     1 times your bet
```

The program allows you to go into debt.  However I'm sure you would never
control-C to kill the program just because you got behind, right?  On the other
hand the program never willingly exits, so you have to leave even when you are
ahead.  :-)

Can you figure out a winning betting "strategy"?  Then can you modify
the program so this "strategy" no longer works?

Notice the clever use of `setjmp(3)` and `longjmp(3)` calls.  Can you keep track
of what state is being saved and restored?

NOTE: the author talks about how it is a single statement. This might not be
strictly true in 2023 for the fixes for it to work so you can look at the
original file [burley.orig.c](burley.orig.c) to see what is meant.


## Author's remarks:

This program plays draw poker.  What is unusual about it is that it
is written as a single statement -- count the semicolons!  (OK, there
are really three statements if you count the variable declarations.)  To
keep things simple, I have avoided the C preprocessor and tricky
statements such as `if`, `for`, `do`, `while`, `switch`, and `goto`.
