## To build:

```sh
make
```

## To run:

```sh
./vik2
```

## Try:

```sh
echo "Do or do not. There is no try."
```

## Judges' remarks:

The fun thing about [CPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) abuses
is that, in most cases, running the
[preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) on them doesn't
help you decipher the obfuscated code.  That's assuming your preprocessor can
take it at all.

## Author's remarks:

### Introduction

It's been a while since the last
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) killer won the
IOCCC.  I thought it was time to relive hour long compile times so I made a
program that does (almost) all computation in the pre-processor. The program
even causes `gcc` (and other pre-processors) to crash when configured to do
maximum number of computations.  The default configuration of the
[Makefile](Makefile) is set to make the program compile in a not too long time.

I've got `cpp` to crash in a couple of different ways. Most common is to
get a segmentation fault, but a couple of times it just got stuck in
some infinite loop.

I actually had to write my own
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) to verify that the
program was doing the right thing...

Since it takes a very long time to compile the program, there is a
symbol that can be defined to shorten the compile time and avoid
compiler errors.

### Features

The program implements an 11-bit
[ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) in the
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor). The ALU has two
[registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register), `X` and `Y`, for
calculations and one status register `SR`.  Each bit in the registers are
represented by one symbol that are either defined or undefined.

The ALU has six instructions:

- `CLR_X` - Clear [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) `X`.

- `CLR_Y` - Clear [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) `Y`.

- `ADD`   - Calculates `X` + `Y` and stores the result in `X`. If the result
	    is larger than 11 bits, the [CARRY
	    bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag) in `SR` is set otherwise
	    the `CARRY` bit is cleared.

- `SUB`   - Calculates `X` - `Y` and stores the result in `X`. If `Y` was larger
	    than `X`, the [CARRY bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag)
	    in `SR` is set otherwise the `CARRY` bit is cleared.

- `TST`   - If `X` == `Y` the `EQ` bit in `SR` is set, otherwise the `EQ` bit is
	    cleared. If `X` < `Y` the `LT` bit in `SR` is set, otherwise the `LT`
	    bit is cleared.

- `INC2`  - Calculates `X` + 2 and stores the result in `X`. The [CARRY
	    bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag) is handled as in the
	    `ADD` instruction.

Internally the [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit)
implements a one bit adder with a carry in and carry out. This adder is the core
of the ALU. The `ADD` instruction uses the one bit adder to create the 11-bit
adder. The SUB instruction is implemented by adding `~Y` to `X` and then add 1.
Finally the `TST` instruction calculates `X-Y` and checks the result and the
[CARRY bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_flag) in the `SR`
[register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) to set the `EQ` and
`LT` bits.

All calculations are made using only `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#endif`,
`#define` and `#undef`. I never assign a value to a defined symbol. The
logic is done by assuming that a defined symbol is 1 and an undefined
symbol is 0. (I guess this means that I have unlimited memory as long as
I only store zeroes (!)).

The application that uses the
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)
[ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) is a [prime
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)
generator. The application uses the same pre-processor directives.
Needed variables are stored in memory represented by one defined or
undefined symbol per bit. When doing arithmetics, the variables are
loaded into the `X` and `Y` registers by defining / undefining the `X` and `Y`
[register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) bits. Then the
calculation is made and the result is moved back to the memory.

The choice of application may be a bit unfortunate since we've already
seen a winning entry calculating [prime
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) in the
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor).
There is a big difference though. The 1988 applin entry uses pre-
processor arithmetic (in a very nice way though). This program only
defines and undefines symbols in a well defined ;) way and doesn't do
any pre-processor arithmetics.

The reason why I chose to do a [prime
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) application is that the
algorithm can be written to do a lot of calculations without a lot of nesting
(`gnu cpp` allows only 200 nested includes).

### Build and Run

First, do a first pre-processing of the initial definitions. The FNAME
symbol must be defined to the name of the output file. If you want to
speed up the compilation, define the `STOP` symbol to anything from `_3` to
`_10`. (The default value is `_10` which will make the compilation take some
time.) Prime numbers up to `2^STOP` will be calculated.

```sh
cpp '-DSTOP=_5' '-DFNAME="tmp1.c"' prog.c tmp1.c
```

Then use `cpp` or any other
[pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) to do the actual
work. This will take some time....

```sh
cpp tmp1.c > tmp2.c
```

Finally compile the pre-processed file

```sh
cc -O tmp2.c -o prog
```

Then run the program to reveal all prime numbers up to 32 (if you used
`STOP=_5` as above):

```sh
./vik2
```

### Verification

I wasn't able to compile the full program which calculates [prime
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to 1024 using `gnu cpp`
(or any other [pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)) so
I had to write my own. Knowing how the program works it was quite easy to reduce
the compilation time from several hours to about one second. I also added some
statistics to my home made pre-processor and I found that calculating prime
numbers up to 1024 makes the program include itself over 6.8 million times (see
the statistics table below).

### Obfuscation

Well, since 98.5% of the program is
[preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) directives, the
main obfuscation is the use of preprocessor directives.

Doing arithmetics without actually using any arithmetic operations makes
the program quite hard to follow.

In order to actually do the calculations, the program includes itself a
lot.

The symbol names are made as short as possible to meet the space limits.
This of course adds to the obfuscation (even though the program is
quite obfuscated with longer, readable macro names.

Finally, I made the 1.5% C code a bit harder to read by breaking all
lines after three characters.

The program has 1029 lines which makes it the longest entry (so far).

Even though the pre-processed and indented output is easier to read, it
is quite hard to find the code in it. The size of the pre-processed file
is several Mb when using `gnu cpp`.

### Limitations

In order to fit the program within the space limits, I had to define the
`#define`, `#endif`, and some other directives as single character symbols.
This does not compile on all
[pre-processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) but using `gnu
cpp` as a first compilation step solves this.

### Statistics

The table below contains some interesting statistics about the compilation of
the program. The intermediate file size is the size of the output file of the
cpp [pre-processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor). The time
taken to pre-process the program were measured using gnu cpp on my 2.0MHz P4
with 512Mb ram and a lot of disk.
