## To build:

```sh
    make
```


## To use:

```sh
    ./newbern [file.dat arg]
```


## Try:

```sh
    ./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

The program is formatted using the same font glyphs as the example
data file.


## Author's remarks:

This is a configurable `banner(1)`-like program.


### Examples:

- To convert a character glyph into a data file:

```sh
    ./newbern char < some_nicely_shaped_text >> data_file
```


- To print a string using glyphs from a data file:

```sh
    ./newbern data_file a_string
```


### Extra functionality

The program can also act as a Morse encoder, unarguably.

It also has double-super-secret encryption capabilities.
Decryption is left as an exercise for the reader.


### Portability

The program assumes an ASCII operating environment.

The program is best viewed with tab-stops set to 8.
