## To build:

This entry requires SDL2 to be installed. See [FAQ 3.8: How do I compile an
IOCCC winner that requires SDL1 or SDL2?](/faq.md#SDL) if you don't have it
installed and don't know how to do so.

```sh
make
```


## To use:

```sh
./prog
```


## Try:

```sh
./prog ioccc.txt

./prog prog.c

./prog sand.txt

./prog sand.alt.txt
```

NOTE: these invocations will take quite some time to finish.


## Judges' remarks:

Can you explain the behavior of the program when [ioccc.txt](ioccc.txt) is given
to it as input?

How would the description of the state machine look like when translated from
Polynomish to English?


## Author's remarks:

### Remarks

This entry graphically displays a simulation of sand falling.
It uses SDL to draw the interface.

The code makes the following assumptions about the underlying system:

* SDL2 is installed from [https://libsdl.org](https://libsdl.org) or your
package manager.
* `double` is an IEEE 754 floating-point type and `sizeof(double)==8`.
* The compiler supports the C99 standard.

In order to simulate the motion of the sand, a cellular automaton is used. The
state transition table is not stored directly. Instead, the program stores the
coefficients of a polynomial that map each state to the correct one. These
coefficients are stored as raw hexadecimal in the `V[]` array, and they are
reinterpreted as `double`s when used. This allows more numeric precision in fewer
characters (base 16 > base 10), and makes the purpose of the array less clear.

The code is laid out graphically as a bucket pouring sand, and it is far easier
to observe this high-level layout than the code's actual function.

The preprocessor is used to both obfuscate the code as a whole and abbreviate
the calls to SDL. Additionally, throughout the code, the variables were named
so that they are short and easily confused with each other.
