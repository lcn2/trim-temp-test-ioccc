# List of files in this entry with a brief description

- [prog.c](prog.c)
    *   This is the source file to the `weasel` program.
- [prog.alt.c](prog.alt.c)
    *   This is the source code file to the `weasel.alt` program.
- [test.sh](test.sh)
    *   Script provided to test the weasel program.
- [test-strings.txt](test-strings.txt)
    * The `test.sh` script reads from this file and runs the program with these
    target strings.
- [Makefile](Makefile)
    * The Makefile that simplifies compilation as well as providing some deep
    magic and other things designed by the IOCCC judges. There's also a `make
    test` target that runs the `test.sh` script. The index.html file shows how
    to pass options to the script itself.
- [weasel.1](weasel.1)
    * The man page for weasel.
- [rpm.html](rpm.html)
    * This file briefly answers 'why' I submitted an rpm spec file.
- [weasel.spec](%%REPO_URL%%/2018/ferguson/weasel.spec)
    * The RPM spec file for building the RPM. This is specific to the entry on
    the IOCCC website but would also be available in the source rpm file if it
    was built.
- [FILES.html](FILES.html)
    * This web page.
