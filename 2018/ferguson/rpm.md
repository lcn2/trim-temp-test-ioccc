## An RPM: what kind of absolute MADNESS is this ?

What kind of crazy idea is this? Install an IOCCC entry? I realise it seems odd
(at best) so why did I make a rpm spec file and why did I hint at building RPMs
for others? I can't say precisely; **certainly I'm under _NO IMPRESSION_ that
anyone else will want to use it** *but the entry was fun enough for me that I
actually will* (a number of my programs over the years are programs I actually
install and I already have done so with this entry).

Nonetheless I am keeping the
[weasel.spec](%%REPO_URL%%/2018/ferguson/weasel.spec) file in the entry as it was part of my
submission but I won't explain here how to set up the build environment or how
to build a RPM; even if anyone did want to (and I know nobody else will) want to
do this, they can figure it out themselves. Again, this was more personal but
since the Judges' remarks were fun for me I am keeping this here anyway.
