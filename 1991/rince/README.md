## To build:

```sh
make all
```

There are two [alternate versions](#alternate-code) which allow one to not be
restricted in movements or to change the maximum number of movements, even if
that's fewer than the original program.


## To use:

```sh
./rince
```


## Alternate code:

The first alternate version, [rince.alt.c](rince.alt.c), disables a maximum move
count so that anyone with enough patience and time can complete the puzzle,
without having to worry about how many moves they make. The second version,
[rince.alt2.c](rince.alt2.c), allows one to reconfigure at compilation the
maximum number of moves, even if that is lowering the count.

The author set the maximum number of moves to 484.


### Alternate build:


```sh
make alt
```

This will build both alt versions where the first one, `rince.alt`, has no
restrictions in the number of movements and the second one, `rince.alt2`, has a
configurable maximum number of moves allowed, defaulting to the entry's max,
484.

To reconfigure the maximum number of moves:

```sh
make clobber CDEFINE+="-DMAX_MOVES=5" alt
```

### Alternate use:

To run the first alt version:

```sh
./rince.alt
```

To run the second alt version:

```sh
./rince.alt2
```

Can you figure out how to make the two alternate versions equivalent in
functionality without modifying the code? That is can you make the second alt
version end up allowing any number of movements?


## Judges' remarks:

In 2023 this entry was updated to allow most ANSI C compilers to compile
the code and to fix a bug where the win or lose message was not seen.


## Author's remarks:

This program is a simple puzzle type game. (I'll leave you to play
it to see the rest of it .. :-) .)  The general idea was to try and
write the smallest playable game, but keep the playability and
enjoyment high.

### Instructions:

Key to map:

```

 ######                 | | | /\   /--\  ==|    /\ | |  Directonal keys
 ######  Solid Wall     | ----||    \/     /\   ||----  (unlock doors of
 ######                 |     \/  ==|     \--/  \/       the same direction)
			|\
			|   <<                    >>    Doors. Unlocked by
	 Blank space    |   <<   vvvvvv  ^^^^^^   >>    the above keys.
			|   <<                    >>
			|\
   ___                  | o__O\   O__O   ^__^   /O__o\
  /   \  'Crushable'    | \___/  /----\ /----\  \___/  The four sprites for
  \___/    boulder      |  _/_\  _/  \_ _/  \_  /_\_   your character :-)
			|\
   ___   uncrushable    |   /\   Diamonds. They can either be found lying
  /@@@\    boulder      |  <  >  around (if only!) or manufacture by pushing
  \@@@/                 |   \/   two 'crushable' rocks together.
			|
```

The general idea of the game is to collect all the diamonds. This must
be done in the minimum amount of moves. I've allowed a margin of 5
moves which brings the moves allowed to `484`. (alter the value of `u` in
the program to set the max moves allowed).

There are two types of boulders. Both can be pushed around, but only
the hollow (crushable) ones can be turned into diamonds (by pushing it
onto another hollow one).

Of the four types of doors (and keys) only 3 have been defined. This
was done to keep the source as low as possible (as I only used 3 in the
map).  To unlock a door simply push a key into the corresponding door.
Take care that it's facing in the correct direction.
