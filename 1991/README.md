# Eighth International Obfuscated C Code Contest

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

This year, we did not single out an entry that was better than all of
the rest.  We selected 3 entries that, in our opinion, went beyond
all of the other entries this year:

- [Grand Prize](westley/index.html) by [Brian
Westley](../authors.html#Brian_Westley)
- [Most well rounded](dds/index.html) by [Diomidis
Spinellis](../authors.html#Diomidis_Spinellis)
- [Best of Show](brnstnd/index.html) by [Daniel J.
Bernstein](../authors.html#Daniel_J_Bernstein)

Name and address information are separated from the actual program
prior to judging.  This eliminates any chance that we would bias our
judging for/against any person or group.  In the end, we are surprised
as you are to see who has won.  Even so, it is worth noting that
[Brian Westley](../authors.html#Brian_Westley) has submitted
a winning entry for the past 5 years!

## A few notes regarding possible changes to the contest:

We did not give awards to some traditional contest categories such as
"_Best Layout_" or "_Worst Abuse of the Rules_".  We felt that to do so
would deny awards to more deserving entries.  These categories have not
been eliminated, and will likely be considered in future years.

A number of entries made use of the following C pre-processor feature:

``` <!---c-->
    #define X define
    #X foo bar
```

This is not permitted under ANSI C.  Some ANSI C compilers do allow this.  In
the future, we do not want programs to use this feature.  Because this request
was not stated in the [1991 rules](rules.txt), we did not reject entries of this
type.  However we provided more portable versions so that more people could
compile these programs.

This year we received entries that made use of the X Window System.
Since this functionality is now available on many systems, we feel that
programs that use these are now portable enough to be valid entries.

We may allow programs to make use of the X Window System libs and include
files, provided that they can operate with a system running at the level
of at least X11r4.  Requiring the use of `imake`, a specific window manager,
specific display hardware, or a specific user interface (`Openl**k`,
`M*tif`, ...) is likely not to be allowed.  We will provide a more detailed
explanation of our viewpoint in next year's rules.

In order to encourage more 'normal' looking C programs, we are considering
the following change to the maximum size rule:

> Your source, not counting any `<space>`, `<tab>`, and a `<newline>` character, and
not counting any '`;`', '`{`' and '`}`' character followed by a `<newline>` character,
must be 1536 bytes or less.  The entire source, counting all characters, be 4096
bytes or less.

Some thought has been given to adding some C++ categories, however this
is not likely to happen soon.  We are waiting until C++ compilers become
common place on a wide number of systems.  We also need time to brace
ourselves for what obfuscation C++ could wield!

Be sure to wait until the 1992 rules are posted before submitting entries.
We may fine tune the rules to reflect the some ideas above.

Please send us comments and suggestions what we have expressed above.
Also include anything else that you would like to see in future contests.
