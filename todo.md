# A todo list of known things to check and/or do
*Last updated: Sun 30 Apr 2023 13:45:52 UTC*

More things will likely be added over time and as items are done they _should
be_ removed from the list IF AND ONLY IF (!!) we are certain it is done (many
times it's thought that this was done only to find out that they are not). It is
hoped that this will be referenced and updated as this is an easy way to keep
track of things that have been done already and what have not been done (mostly
not been done).

- Find entries with bugs and INABIAF and add to [bugs.md](/bugs.md).
    For instance a INABIAF section should be added to [bugs.md](bugs.md) for
    [2004/jdalbec](2004/jdalbec/jdalbec.) based on the README.md file.

- Resolve as many of the issues in [bugs.md](/bugs.md) with the exception of the
INABIAF ones. This is likely not possible but some certainly can be fixed.

- Check for typos in README.md files.

- Go through all year README.md files that is 1984/README.md, 1985/README.md and
so on. As of *Sun 30 Apr 2023 13:45:52 UTC* the following years have been
finished: 1984, 1985, 1986, 2004, 2005.

- Verify which README.md files have not been checked for correct formatting and
fix any issues.
    * This includes author information: not only at first column but making sure
    that the lines end with spaces so that the rendered output does not end up
    on one line only.
    * [Cody Boone Ferguson](/winners.html#Cody_Boone_Ferguson) has done many and
    has some kind of record of what he's done but these can be added later by
    having a list of years to check.
    * NOTE: as of yesterday, 21 April 2023, years up through part of 2001 have
    been checked except that a few years might need typo checks (or a bit more
    thoroughly). It's very likely I won't keep this updated until it's finished
    but I wanted to note it now.

- Remove addresses from older winning entries but (if known) keep country code +
add country code to winners.csv. As of half past 4 Pacific time on 22 April 2023
only the years through 1986 are done. This should not take much time but I
(Cody) am bored with it for now and would rather do other more important things.
This will likely not be updated until after it's done (and when I remember to
remove it - I expect that when I go for it I'll do it in one sitting or maybe a
few sittings with a few brief breaks).
