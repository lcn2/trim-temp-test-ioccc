## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
```

NOTE: this entry requires `X11/Xlib.h` header file and the X11 library to
compile. macOS users running Mountain Lion and later will need to download and
install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) in order to compile and run this
entry.


### Bugs and (Mis)features:

The current status of this entry is:

```
    STATUS: INABIAF - please **DO NOT** fix
    STATUS: missing or dead link - please provide them
```

For more detailed information see [1996/jonth in bugs.html](../../bugs.html#1996_jonth).


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./jonth :0 :0
```

NOTE: the two boards will be on top of each other so you will have to drag one
off the other so that you can properly play.


NOTE: if there is no X service open this will crash. If this is the case you
might try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./jonth
```

These are supposed to happen.  As is written in the
[The Jargon File](http://catb.org/jargon/html/F/feature.html):

```
    That's not a bug, that's a feature.
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./jonth host1:0 host2:0
```


## Judges' remarks:

For extra credit, figure out how you can cheat by taking over a square already
occupied by an opponent.


## Author's remarks:

This is multi-user tic-tac-toe for X Windows. You may give one or two X displays
as arguments to this game.

### Known bugs:

Sometimes on Solaris, X gets confused and this program core dumps. The solution:
give two display arguments (`./jonth host:0 host:0`).

If one (or both) windows look like a copy of the window(s) below, try
`xrefresh(1)` command.

Have a `nice(1)` day.
