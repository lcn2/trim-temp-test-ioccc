## Judges' comments

We were impressed by the author's ability to render spheres in 3D 
in a very small chunk of code.

## Author's comments

This program shows flying spheres. The program eats CPU on lesser
equipped systems. The program will run until termination. Terminal 
must be vt100 or better with 80 columns and 24 rows or more.
