## To build:

```sh
make all
```


## To run:

```sh
./gandalf
```

## Try:

```sh
PATH=.:$PATH
./hatcat
./cathat
```

And next try:

```sh
./cathat
`pwd`/cathat
```

Care to guess why these execute differently?  Only the
compiler knows ... ok maybe other things like the author,
the judges and maybe you too?


## Judges' remarks:

For misleading C pre-processor output, try:

```sh
cc -E gandalf.c
```


## Author's remarks:

The program requires an ASCII system.
