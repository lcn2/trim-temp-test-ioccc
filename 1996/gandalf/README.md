For more detailed information see [1996/gandalf in bugs.html](../../bugs.html#1996_gandalf).


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./gandalf
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```

As the script asks, care to guess why these execute differently?  Only the
compiler knows ... ok maybe other things like the author, the judges and perhaps
you too?

BTW: it is perilous to 'try' the patience of
[Gandalf](https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/gandalf.html). Go ahead, 'try' it! :-)


## Judges' remarks:

For misleading C pre-processor output, try:

``` <!---sh-->
    cc -E gandalf.c
```


## Author's remarks:

The program requires an ASCII system.
