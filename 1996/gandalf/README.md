## To build:

        make all

	NOTE: This entry might not compile when using modern compilers.

### To run

	./gandalf

## Judges' comments

    Also try:

	PATH=.:$PATH
	./hatcat
	./cathat

     And next try:

	./cathat
	`pwd`/cathat

     Care to guess why these execute differently?  Only the
     compiler knows ... ok maybe other things like the author,
     the judges and maybe you too?

     For mis-leading C pre-processor output, try:

	cc -E gandalf.c

## Author's comments

    The program requires an ASCII system.
