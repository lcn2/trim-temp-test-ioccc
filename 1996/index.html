<h1 id="thirteenth-international-obfuscated-c-code-contest">Thirteenth
International Obfuscated C Code Contest</h1>
<h2 id="standard-ioccc-stuff">Standard IOCCC stuff</h2>
<p>View the <code>index.html</code> web page for the given winning entry
for information on how on how to compile it and how to run the winning
program. Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what
it does! You may then wish to look at the Author’s remarks for even more
details.</p>
<p>The IOCCC has an official home page: <a
href="https://www.ioccc.org">www.ioccc.org</a>, containing previous
winning entries, information about the judges, announcements and much
more.</p>
<p>Use <code>make</code> to compile entries. It is possible that on BSD
or non-Unix systems the Makefile needs to be changed. See the Makefile
for details.</p>
<p>Read over the Makefile for compile/build issues. Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
<code>#define</code> i.e. the <code>-D</code> flag).</p>
<h2 id="where-are-larry-bassel-and-barbara-frezza">Where are Larry
Bassel and Barbara Frezza?</h2>
<p>It is not true that Larry Bassel avoided the 13th IOCCC on grounds of
superstition! Larry (as well as Landon) is fond of prime numbers. Larry
is so fond of prime numbers that he decided to become a graduate student
in number theory at UC San Diego. For this reason Larry decided to sit
out this year and plans to be back next year.</p>
<p>Barbara Frezza also went to San Diego to enter into law school at the
same time. Her cooking in the role of official chef was sorely missed.
We look forward to her return to the contest next year as well.</p>
<p>Both Larry and Barbara have taken important new steps in their lives
and we wish them the best. When it is all over, Larry will be able to
produce obfuscated mathematical proofs, and Barbara will be able
deobfuscate the many legal obfuscations. :-)</p>
<h2 id="remarks-on-some-of-the-entries">Remarks on some of the
entries</h2>
<p>This year, <a href="../authors.html#Jens_Schweikhardt">Jens
Schweikhardt</a> won 3 times … a new IOCCC record. Meanwhile, <a
href="../authors.html#Brian_Westley">Brian Westley</a> came up with his
8th winning entry, twice the number of the next highest count. But with
people like Schweikhardt around, this lead could fall fast.</p>
<p>As we stated in the <a href="guidelines.txt">guidelines</a>, the
authors of the winning entries are as much news to us as they are to you
because we keep authorship separate from rest of the entry. Some people
have it, we guess!</p>
<p>There were a few very good entries that might have won if it were not
for the fact that they didn’t work. If you didn’t win, but think you had
a chance: test your program, fix it and submit it next year!</p>
<h2 id="a-few-notes-regarding-future-contests">A few notes regarding
future contests</h2>
<p>There will be no 1997 contest.</p>
<p>The next contest will not open until sometime in March 1998, and will
close sometime around the end of May 1998. The rules for the 1998
contest have not been formed at this time and are not expected to be
ready for distribution until late February 1998.</p>
<p>So what happened to 1997? Well the next USENIX Technical Conference
will be held Jun 15-19, 1998 (in New Orleans, US). The 18 month span
between conferences will cause the IOCCC to skip over 1997.</p>
<p>Be sure to wait until the 1998 rules are posted before submitting
entries. Rules differ from year to year, sometimes in significant
ways.</p>
<p>Please send us comments and suggestions what we have expressed above.
Also include anything else that you would like to see in future
contests. Send such email to:</p>
<pre><code>judges@toad.com</code></pre>
<p>If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please
drop us a line. We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is
used.</p>
