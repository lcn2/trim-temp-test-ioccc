<h1 id="implementation-notes">Implementation notes</h1>
<p>Due to the long time this has been slowly evolving, it’s hard to
describe quite whether it’s been <code>implemented</code>. I think
perhaps evolve is a better term. The basic concept behind the program is
to describe a game as a simple, slightly cheaty, cellular automata
system, with some of the transitions bound to key presses.</p>
<p>For instance, assume you wish to make a boulder <code>o</code> roll
off a hill <code>/</code> A standard automata would have 2 rules
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>
        o..         ...   
        \..  --&gt;  &#39;o&#39;       .o.  --&gt;  &#39;.&#39;    
        ...         .\.   </code></pre>
<p>However, the system I devised, in order to keep things small and
neat(!), was to define a 3x3 to 3x3 map (instead of the 3x3 to 1x1 shown
above). Hence:</p>
<pre><code>    .o.   ...
    .\.  --&gt;  .\o
    ...   ...</code></pre>
<p>This does of course have the odd problem with clashes. What if we
want to roll two boulders down simultaneously towards the same square. I
perform no buffering, and so this situation is just a ‘fight it out’ and
let which ever transition has priority win. Such a case may produce the
following change of maps (depending on which ‘roll’ transition is used
first).</p>
<pre><code>    o.o         ..o     o..
    \./ changes to  \o/  or to  \o/
    ...         ...     ...</code></pre>
<p>I claim that it is possible to perform all of the 3x3 to 1x1
transitions in a 3x3 to 3x3 based system. One other feature added in is
a workaround for the ‘no buffering’ problem. If we define a space ship
(as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space
Invaders</a> example) to fly right, and we are ‘walking through’ our map
from top-left to bottom-right, then it is easy to foresee a situation
where our space ship would zip right as far as possible in only the one
cycle of the automata. However, a similar leftwards-bound space ship
would only move the required one square. For this reason I have two
lists of transitions and apply them independently of each other; first
top-left to bottom right, and the second in the reverse direction. This
means that I can make any ‘object’ move by any amount in a single
transition.</p>
<p>Now comes the key important addition to make it ‘game’ worthy - the
addition of external control by the user. This is done by requesting
that some transitions are only valid when a certain key has been
pressed. So for example, if we (an <code>@</code> symbol) wish to move
right when the <code>l</code> key is hit we have a transition like:</p>
<h2 id="key-l">Key: l</h2>
<pre><code>    * * *       * * *
    * @ .       * . @
    * * *       * * *</code></pre>
<p>Here I also use wildcards. On the match side (left) of the
transition, an asterisk will match against any character. On the update
side (right), an asterisk means ‘keep whatever was here before’. So the
above example simply means to swap the <code>@</code> and <code>.</code>
around when <code>l</code> is pressed. For the purposes of space saving,
this transition is shrunk to a single line.</p>
<h2 id="key-k">Key: K</h2>
<pre><code>    a b c       1 2 3
    d e f       4 5 6
    g h i       7 8 9</code></pre>
<p>is written as: <code>eabcdfghi512346789K</code>.</p>
<p>If there are no keys needed for this transition, the character
<code>*1</code> should be used instead. Now the format of the game
description file is now the following (angle brackets denote an ‘entity’
to be defined):</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;top-bot transition&gt;*\n&lt;bot-top transition&gt;*\n&lt;X size&gt;[ \t]+&lt;Y size&gt;\n
    &lt;map&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;X size&gt;</code> should take into account the newline
at the end of each line of map, and hence should also be one larger than
expected.</p>
