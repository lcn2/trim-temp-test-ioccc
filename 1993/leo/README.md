## To build:

```sh
make all
```


## To use:

To have the computer guess:

```sh
./leo [colors]
```

To guess the computer's number:

```sh
./mind [colors]
```

where:

[colors] is the number of possible colors (1 to 15) (default: 6)


## Judges' remarks:

\
By default, the number of colors is 6.  You may specify a
value of between 1 and 15 colors.  See the author's notes
for instructions of how to play.

We look forward to more entries from the newer members of the\
International Internet community.


## Author's remarks:

This program plays
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game), if you call it by a name ending by
'd', otherwise it _solves_ Mastermind. Call it without parameters
to use 6 digits (colors), or indicate the number of possible digits
(you cannot change the number of positions so easily).

The number in parentheses is the number of possible combinations,
based on previous questions and answers.  If you solve the puzzle,
"(1)" indicates that your previous moves are enough to give correct
answer.  If the program acts as solver and terminates prematurely,
it means that you're mistaken in your answers to its question(s).
Question marks indicate the number of digits you have to enter
(either 4 when you guess or 2 when computer guesses).

Note that the program uses the same code for both player and
solver, and the only place where it makes a difference is the
interactive part. Many obfuscations have been made to achieve
this.  An expression giving `(bulls * 16 + cows)` from two numbers
is, however, quite straightforward :-) , as well as the arithmetic
of binary coded colors-base numbers is.

### Limitations: maximum number of digits (colors) is 14 (1..F).

Suggestions: Use terminal (or emulator) with non-destructive
backspaces. Do "disable scrolling" on cmdtool or similar emulators.

#### Bugs: Please don't type ^D at the prompt!!

##### EXAMPLE: Suppose we think of 1234

```
judges-385> ./leo
    (1296): 6433
    ?? 12       # one 3 is a bull, another is a cow, and 4 is a cow
    (160): 5363
    ?? 02       # both 3's are cows
    (21): 4231
    ?? 22       # 2 and 3 are bulls, 4 and 1 are cows
    (2): 4132
    ?? 13       # 3 is a bull; 1, 2 and 4 are cows
    (1): 1234
    ?? 40       # you may enter everything there
```

##### EXAMPLE: Guess the computer's number

```
judges-387> ./mind
(1296): ???? 1122   # my strategy isn't the best, just as example
00
(256): ???? 3344
20
(18): ???? 5566
02
(6): ???? 3654
11
(2): ???? 3355
00
(1): ???? 6444
40		   # we have guessed the number
```
