## Judges' remarks:

See the author's POSIX P1003.2-like documentation file [ant.txt](ant.txt) for
more information.

This program demonstrates that POSIX doesn't guarantee readability.  :-)


## Author's remarks:

Some of the features of my entry are:

-  "Lengthy" POSIX.2 style specification and manual :) :)
-  Useful subset of POSIX.2 Extended Regular Expressions.
-  Recursive ERE parser/compiler that generates an NFA railroad.
-  Lazy NFA to DFA evaluation to improve performance speed.
-  Code tested on a variety of platforms.
-  Make driven test script.
-  Can be compiled with ANSI or K&R C.
-  Not a toy, but actually useful and usable on systems that use DOS.
-  See also [ant.txt](ant.txt).
