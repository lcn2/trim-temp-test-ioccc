## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make all
```


### Bugs and (Mis)features:

The current status of this entry is:

```
    STATUS: INABIAF - please **DO NOT** fix
```

For more detailed information see [1993 schnitzi bugs](../../bugs.html#1993_schnitzi).


## To use:

```<!---sh-->
    ./schnitzi file
```

where


`file` is a file containing some text.

Certain input will cause the program to fail as described
in [1993 schnitzi bugs](../../bugs.html#1993_schnitzi).


## Try:

```<!---sh-->
    ./schnitzi schnitzi.info
    # ask some questions suggested by the author, noted below
```

We also suggest you ask the program the following questions:

```<!---sh-->
    Who is Mark Schnitzus?

    Who was Jack the Ripper ?
```

Notice how it still manages to answer the first question despite there being an
intentional spelling error there.

Try feeding the program source to the program and ask both:

```<!---sh-->
    What is cat ?
    What is cat?
```

What happens if you ask it other questions with and without a space before the
`?`?


## Judges' remarks:

After this program prints the contents of 'file', ask it
some questions related to the text.

The author suggests the following questions when using
[schnitzi.info](schnitzi.info):


- Who is Mark Schnitzius?
- What exactly does this program do?
- What language is it written in?
- Has the Loch Ness monster really been captured?
- Who was Hitler?
- Were the NASA Moon landings faked?
- Is it true that Elvis is alive?
- Do colorless green ideas sleep furiously?

We suggest you try using the body (minus the header and signature line)
of a Usenet article.  You might want to try something from alt.flame.  :-)

NOTE: If you have certain  `'` in the question this entry might fail.


## Author's remarks:

I wanted to write a program that would read in a text file in
natural language (such as English) and answer questions about that
text file.  I thought this might be a complicated task, and I was
right -- it took me over 800 bytes.  Of course, it doesn't always
work, but that's AI for you.

This program accepts the name of a text file as the first parameter.  For
example, to run it on the supplied data file called 'schnitzi.info' you would
type `./schnitzi schnitzi.info`.  It echoes the file, then gives you a prompt
where you may type in questions about that text.  The more words you use which
are actually present in the text file, the better results you get.  You'll need
to hit `ctrl-c` to break out of the program.  Just hitting `return` at the
prompt will reprint the paragraph.

If you're curious as to how it works, I guess you could feed in the
source as the input file and ask "How does this work?" at the prompt,
but I'm not guaranteeing any results...


### Compilation notes

-  The use of `strcasecmp(3)` may be non-standard.  `strcmp(3)` can be substituted for
it, with a slight performance penalty.

-  This program depends on the first command-line parameter, typically called
`argv[0]`, to hold the name of the executable.  It is my understanding that this
property of `argv[0]` is not guaranteed on some systems.


### Obfuscation

-  It uses a hidden string to test for punctuation.

-  The layout, variable names, and expression format have been chosen in such a
way as to cause visual confusion.

-  It uses uses external `system(3)` calls to echo the text file and break up the
question into individual words with a recursive call.

-  It uses a clever hack to simulate artificial intelligence.

The text for the info file, by the way, consists largely of headlines
from the Weekly World News.
