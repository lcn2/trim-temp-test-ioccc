<h1 id="the-patience-puzzle">The Patience puzzle</h1>
<p>The Patience puzzle, probably of Chinese origin, consists of an iron
U-shaped piece and several rings that link around it. The physical shape
of the puzzle is very difficult to describe verbally, but here is an
attempt.</p>
<p>This description of the puzzle is presented as a set of instructions
for constructing the puzzle. Start with a flat piece of iron about 15
centimeters long by about two centimeters wide. Drill six holes in the
piece of iron. Through each hole, place a rod. The rod should have a
diameter slightly less than that of the hole so that it can move freely.
One end of the rod is like the head of a nail and is larger than the
hole to prevent it from coming free. The other end is looped around a
metal ring with a diameter of about five centimeters. This completely
prevents the iron rod from separating from the base. Each rod, in
addition to going through the iron base, goes through the ring at the
end of the rod to its right. The only rod free of this restriction is
the rightmost rod. What has been described so far is one of the two
components of the puzzle.</p>
<p>The other component is another iron rod shaped like a <code>U</code>.
The <code>U</code> is as long from the tips to the base as the original
piece of iron with the holes in it. The ends of the <code>U</code> are
looped around another ring of about five centimeters in diameter. In the
puzzle’s initial configuration, the <code>U</code> is placed through the
rings so that it is held in place by the iron rods. Imagine starting
with the <code>U</code> piece before the iron loop is placed at the end.
Slide the legs of the <code>U</code> through the loops so that the iron
rods securing the loops to the metal strip go up the center of the
<code>U</code>. Placing the final ring at the ends of the <code>U</code>
prevents it from coming out. The object of the puzzle is to free the
<code>U</code>-shaped piece from the other piece.</p>
<p>The following illustration (sideways) shows a three-ring case of this
puzzle. If you look carefully, you can see that the first ring could be
lifted over the edge of the <code>U</code> and slid down through the
center of the <code>U</code>, thereby freeing the <code>U</code> from
the first iron rod. The second ring can also be freed in the initial
configuration since it is already over the rod for the first ring. The
third ring cannot be moved, however, since it is blocked by the iron rod
to which the first ring is attached. If the first first is removed, then
the third ring is no longer blocked by the first ring’s iron rod and can
be removed freely. The second ring, however cannot be moved if the first
ring is gone because it will then be blocked by the first ring in its
new position outside of the <code>U</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of the three-ring case. The bottom of the
puzzle is on the left-hand side of the page.</p>

<p>This puzzle takes other forms as well. One such puzzle is called
“Spin-Out”. This puzzle consists of one plastic piece that encases
another piece that can slide in and out of it. The movement of the
smaller piece is restricted by discs that, when turned to one angle,
lock the smaller piece inside the larger one and, when turned the other
way, allow it to move. This puzzle is as difficult to describe as the
first and, since I don’t have one in front of me, I will not attempt to
describe it. The object of this puzzle is to free the smaller piece from
the larger one. The other puzzle that is like this one consists of a
cylinder with rods protruding from the top. The rods can be slid from
the center to the edge of the cylinder constrained by a series of discs
in the center. The discs have cuts in them that allow some rods to move
and force others in one place based on the relative rotations of the
discs. The object here is to move all the rods from the inside to the
outside.</p>
<p>What makes these puzzles similar is that the physical shapes of the
puzzles put the same restrictions on the movement of the pieces.
Specifically, there is always one piece that is free to move. The only
other piece that is free to move is the second one that is still
attached to the base it is trying to be freed from. In the case of the
original puzzle, consider the rings numbered from 1 to 6 with ring 1
being the one at the closed end of the <code>U</code>. Ring 1 can always
be removed from or added to the <code>U</code>. In the initial state,
when all rings are around the <code>U</code>, ring 2 is the other one
that can be moved because it is second. If ring 1 is removed, then only
two operations are possible: the restoration of ring 1 and the removal
of ring 3. This is because ring 1 is always movable, and ring 3 is
currently the second ring still attached to the <code>U</code>. This
constraint leads to a recursive solution to the puzzle. Like the <a
href="hanoi.md">Towers of Hanoi</a>, the number of steps to solve this
puzzle is exponential in the number of rings.</p>
