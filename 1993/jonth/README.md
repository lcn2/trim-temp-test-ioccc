## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make all
```

**NOTE**: this entry requires the `X11/Xlib.h` header file and the X11 library to
compile.  For more information see the
FAQ on "[X11](../../faq.html#X11)".


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./jonth     # must be run on an X11 server
```


## Judges' remarks:

Use `h` and `l` to shift objects left or right.  Use `k` to
rotate and press SPACE to drop.

This program's output may be even more obfuscated when played
on inverse video.  :-)


## Author's remarks:

This is `jonth` (`jon's t(h)etris`) for the X Window System.

This program is also an example of data abstraction.  The `X` array is
after initialization hidden by the well defined macros `t`, `u` and `F`.

This program is highly portable as it runs on a "Notebook" size SPARC.
This program will not work on machines where `sizeof(int)!=sizeof(void *)`.
