NOTE: `n` is an integer.


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh

## Judges' remarks:

Don't read the author remarks until you're ready for the spoiler.
Just stop and read the program; it won't take long.  Once you've figured
out what it does, run it.  It may surprise you.

This entry won, not because the obfuscation is impenetrable, but because
it successfully fooled half of the judges, including me.


## Author's remarks:

### Description

For 15 years, IOCCC entries have obfuscated programs using esoteric,
difficult-to-interpret, confusing algorithms.  This entry finally bucks
that trend and obfuscates in the most "obvious" way possible: by
painstakingly describing the algorithm in clear pseudocode.  Even novice
programmers will recognize that the program should find and print prime
numbers up to a given number (as specified on the command line).

But novice programmers especially know that mistakes are often made in
translating pseudocode to real code, often resulting in programs with
unexpected and confusing output.  Clearly, the program contains several
syntax "mistakes" (e.g. `LessThanOrEqualTo`) and blatant "errors" (e.g.
`Zero`).  This program clearly requires "debugging."

As a result of these "bugs", the program does not calculate primes at all.
Instead, the program reads input from `stdin` and returns garbled text on
`stdout`.  Fortunately, you can recover the original message simply by
running the program a second time.  Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./primenum n < textfile | ./primenum n > textfile2
    diff textfile textfile2
```

where n is the same number (modulo 64).  So, the prime number generator
is actually a simple text encoder/decoder!  Of course, don't forget that
argument, otherwise the "bugs" in the program will cause it to crash!

### Features

- The program attempts to mislead the reader into thinking that it
  generates prime numbers.  It does this by:
    * describing a correct algorithm in pseudocode;
    * using partially correct conversion of pseudocode to real code;
    * using suggestive variable names; and
    * using a suggestive program name.

- The program demonstrates a novel method of abusing the C preprocessor.

- Determining how the filter algorithm works is left as an exercise to the
  reader.

- OK, so running it through the preprocessor strips away the prime
  number front.  But ye be warned: "not a11 variab1es1es are identica1" :-)

- Other features include
    * useless variables
    * useless if
    * a for loop that's used as an if statement
    * dependence on the high bit being 0

- Try also
  `echo THIS MESSAGE IS IN ALL CAPS | ./primenum 32`
