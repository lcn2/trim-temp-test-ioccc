## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make
```


## To use:

```<!---sh-->
    make check
```

You'll need to have both [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) installed to run all the automated
checks.

If you do not have both, however, you can still do the below in the [try](#try)
section to enjoy the entry. The [Makefile](Makefile) `check` rule will check if
you have both and if either is not found it will report it and tell you where to
download one or both before exiting.


## Try:

```<!---sh-->
    less jpeg.c
```

Next look at `jpeg.jpg` in an image viewer program.


## Judges' remarks:

This is a program which, when fed its own source, generates a program that
almost is its whitespace inverse, which, in its order, generates a JPEG file
(speaking of file size abuse, that is about 16.4 times larger than a PBM file
with the same image, but the source was also abusing the size counting
program...)

Don't pay attention to the OCR ~~behind the ruby curtain~~ --- it's a
straightforward bitmap comparison.


## Author's remarks:

### Highlights

* LZ77-like compression for font and template data
* tiny JPEG encoder
    * Zig-zag space-filling curve
    * Discrete cosine transform
    * JPEG Huffman encoding (cheating)


### Notes

I picked JPEG instead of PNG, GIF, or BMP
because it is the most difficult to generate.
I believe that the JPEG encoder is the world's smallest ever.

Nevertheless, the program was too big to meet the IOCCC's size rule.  So I
created a smaller bootstrap program that generates the main program.  `endoh2.c`
contains fragments of the main program *as a comment* which `iocccsize -i` does
*not* count.  I gratefully thank the judges for spoiling the size rule this
year.

I think the program will work on any major platforms and compilers.
