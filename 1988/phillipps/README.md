## To build:

```<!---sh-->
    make all
```


## Judges' remarks:

Compile and run without parameters.

The program is smaller than even the 'compressed' form of its output,
and thus represents a new departure in text compression standards.

The judges thought that this program looked like what you would get
by pounding on the keys of an old typewriter at random.
