1988 marked the "The Fifth International Obfuscated C Code Contest"


Look at the README.md file for the given winner for information
on how to compile the winner and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's comments for even more details.

The maximum size of entries was raised from 1024 to 1536 bytes, however
smaller entries were encouraged.  Due to the "Best Abuse of the Rules"
winner of 1987, a limit of 160 chars in the compile line was introduced.

This year, the Grand Prize was given to the most unusual entry and best
abuse of the C Preprocessor rather than the most well rounded entry.

Rules and results were posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix and
alt.sources.  The 1988 winners will be published in the Micro/Systems
Journal.

Winning entries for previous years were repackaged with each year
being in its own directory.  Make files and hints were also provided.
The package was posted to the: comp.sources.unix newsgroup.  They are
also available on a wide number of Usenet archive sites.
