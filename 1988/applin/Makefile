# This entry took 75 minutes to compile on a Amdahl 5980-300E
# (a 55658 Dhyrstone/sec/cpu machine) using the System V cpp.
# (The GNU cpp when defined as BIG_CPP took only 45 seconds.)
# Your cpp may not be able to compile it due to a common bug
# that results in cpp running out of space.  The routine
# 'zsmall' is a smaller version of the applin.c entry.
