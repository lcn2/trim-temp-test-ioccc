## To build:

```sh
make all
```

NOTE: this version is a fixed version for modern C compilers. See the [Alternate
code](#alternate-code) section below for how to use the original and why one
might wish to do so.


### Try:

```sh
./westley
```

Also try:

```sh
./try.sh
```

to show the code with followed by the result so you can truly see the magic.


## Alternate code:

This version is the original which might not work as you expect nowadays.


### Alternate build:

```sh
make alt
```


### Alternate use:

To see if your compiler has the problem described in the Judges' remarks below,
try:

```sh
./westley.alt
```

Does it show the same output as `westley`?


## Judges' remarks:

Your compiler must parse

```c
#define _ -a
-_
```

as `--a` and not `-(-a)` or some other tokenized form.  Some strictly
conforming ANSI C Preprocessors may object to this: for such
compilers, you can elide the non-standard token-pasting requirement
by changing the #define line to:

```c
#define _ F-->00||F-OO--;
```

This is what the modified code in [westley.c](westley.c) does whereas the alt
code is the original.

You might enjoy looking at the output of:

```sh
cc -E westley.alt.c
```
