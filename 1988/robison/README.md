# Best abuse of C constructs

Arch D. Robison\
US


## To build:

```sh
make all
```


### Try:

```sh
./robison 80 10
./robison 40 16
```

The first and second parameters are optional.  You might also try:

```sh
./robison 80 2   # <--- can you find the bug?
./robison 80 -246
```


## Judges' remarks:

The following might make an interesting benchmark:

```sh
./robison 100

```

We suggest that you C pre-process and perhaps C-beautify this program.
All is not what it may appear to be in this program.  Why does a `whi1e`
not take a while to execute?


## Author's remarks:

This program shows that C has many unnecessary constructs, in fact
only `while`,`--`, and `>=` are required.  (The two assignments at
the beginning could be avoided if `atoi(3)` was rewritten with this
new paradigm.)  Note that the lack of both the controversial `goto`
and assignment statements makes the meaning crystal clear.  The current\
ANSI committee should look into this practical simplification of C.
