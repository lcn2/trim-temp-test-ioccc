<h1 id="hints-and-suggestions">HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:</h1>
</div>
</div>
<p>You are encouraged to examine the <a href="../years.html">winners of previous contests</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <a href="rules.html">rules</a> change from year to year, so some <a href="../years.html">winning
entries</a> might not be valid submissions this year; what <em>was</em> unique
and novel one year <em>might be ‘old’ the next year</em>.</p>
<p>A submission is usually examined in a number of ways. We typically apply
a number of tests to a submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the original source</li>
<li>convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#define</code> <em>and</em> <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>run it through a C beautifier</li>
<li>examine the algorithm</li>
<li>compile it (with flags to enable all warnings)</li>
<li>execute it</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider how your submission looks in each of the above tests.
You should ask yourself if your submission remains obscure after it has been
‘<em>cleaned up</em>’ by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.</p>
<p>Your submission need not pass all of the above tests. In certain
cases, a test is not important. Entries that compete for the
‘<strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong>’ need not do as well as
others in terms of their algorithm. On the other hand, given
two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the submission that
does something interesting when you run it.</p>
<p>We try to avoid limiting creativity in our <a href="rules.html">rules</a>. As such, we
leave the contest open for creative rule interpretation. As in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">real
life</a> programming, interpreting a
requirements document or a customer request is important. For this reason, we
often award ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some variation to a submission that illustrates this
point in an ironic way.</p>
<p>We do realize that there are holes in the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>, and invite
entries to attempt to exploit them. We will award ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some
variation and then plug the hole next year.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When we do need to plug a hole in the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> or <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a>, we will attempt to use a very small plug, if not
smaller. Or, maybe not. :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There may be less than 2^7+1 reasons why these <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a> seem obfuscated.
</p>
<p>Check out your program and be sure that it works. We sometimes make
the effort to debug a submission that has a slight problem, particularly
in or near the final round. On the other hand, we have seen some
of the best entries fall down because they didn’t work.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We tend to look down on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime
number</a> printer that claims that
16 is a prime number. If you do have a bug, you are better off
documenting it. Noting “<em>this submission sometimes prints the 4th power
of a prime by mistake</em>” would save the above submission. And sometimes,
a strange bug/feature can even help the submission! Of course, a correctly
working submission is best. Clever people will note that 16 might be prime
under certain conditions. Wise people, when submitting something clever
will fully explain such cleverness in their submission’s <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p>People who are considering to just use some complex mathematical
function or state machine to spell out something such as “<em>hello,
world!</em>” <strong>really really, <em>and we do mean REALLY</em>, do need to be more creative</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultra-obfuscated programs are, in some cases, easier to
deobfuscate than subtly-obfuscated programs. Consider using
misleading or subtle tricks layered on top of or under an
appropriate level of obfuscation. A clean looking program with
misleading comments and variable names might be a good start.</p>
<p>When programs use VTxxx/ANSI sequences, they should NOT be limited to a
specific terminal brand. Those programs that work in a standard xterm
are considered more portable.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a> (the size rule) refers to the use of the IOCCC size
tool called <code>iocccsize(1)</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry
repo</a> for the <code>iocccsize(1)</code> tool.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To further clarify <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, we subdivided it into two parts,
<strong>2a</strong> and <strong>2b</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The overall size limit (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a>) on <code>prog.c</code> is now <strong>4993 bytes</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Your submission must satisfy BOTH the maximum size <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a> <strong>AND</strong> the IOCCC size tool <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
This IOCCC size tool imposes a 2nd limit on C code size (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a>). To check your code against <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>    iocccsize prog.c</code></pre>
<p>The IOCCC size tool algorithm may be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size tool counts most C reserved words (keyword, secondary, and selected
preprocessor keywords) as 1. The size tool counts all other octets as 1
excluding ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ followed by
ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ octet immediately
before the end of file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ASCII whitespace includes ASCII tab, ASCII space, ASCII newline,
ASCII formfeed, and ASCII carriage return.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ are within a C string, they may still not be
counted by the IOCCC size tool. This is a <em>feature</em>, not a bug!
</p>
<p>In cases where the above summary and the algorithm implemented by
the IOCCC size tool source code conflict, the algorithm implemented
by the IOCCC size tool source code is preferred by the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There are at least 2 other reasons for selecting 2503 as the 2nd limit besides
the fact that 2503 is a prime. These reasons may be searched for and discovered
if you are <a href="https://t5k.org/curios/page.php/2503.html">“Curios!” about 2503</a>.
:-) Moreover, 2053 was the number of the kernel disk pack of one of the judge’s
BESM-6, and 2503 is a decimal anagram of 2053.
</p>
<p>Take note that this secondary limit imposed by the IOCCC size tool
obviates some of the need to <code>#define</code> C reserved words in an effort
to get around the size limits of <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>.</p>
<p>Yes Virginia, <strong>that is a hint</strong>!</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> size was changed from
4096 to 4993: a change that keeps the “2b to 2a” size ratio to a
value similar to the <a href="../faq.html#size_rule2001-2012">2001-2012</a> and
<a href="../faq.html#size_rule2013-2020">2013-2020</a> IOCCC eras.

<a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a> (the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> rule) states that
you <strong>MUST</strong> use the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool to package your submission tarball.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>
for the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool and below for more details.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: make <strong>CERTAIN</strong> you have the most recent version of the
<code>mkiocccentry</code> toolkit! See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#obtaining_mkiocccentry">obtaining the mkiocccentry toolkit</a>”.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry</code> runs a number of checks, by the tool itself and by executing
other tools, <em>before</em> packaging your xz compressed tarball. Once the tarball is
packaged it will run <code>txzchk(1)</code>, which will also run <code>fnamchk(1)</code>, as part of
its algorithm.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>mkiocccentry</code> encounters an <strong>error</strong> the program will exit and the xz
compressed tarball <strong>will not be formed</strong>. For instance, if <code>chkentry(1)</code> (see
below) fails to validate the <code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code>
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> files that <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> creates,
it is an error and <strong>possibly</strong> a bug that you should <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report as a bug at the

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
However, even if <code>mkiocccentry</code> or one of the tools it invokes reports an error,
it <strong>does not</strong> necessarily mean it is a bug in the code. It might be an issue with
your submission. Thus if you report an error as a bug it might not be something
that will be fixed as there might not be anything wrong with the tools.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, some conditions are <strong>warnings</strong> and it allows you to
override these, if you wish. If you’re brave enough you can use the <code>-W</code> option
to ignore all warnings but this is a big risk; the <code>-y</code> option will assume
‘<em>yes</em>’ to most questions but this is also a big risk. Needless to say, we do
NOT recommend these options.

<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will write two JSON files: <code>.auth.json</code> and
<code>.info.json</code>. These files contain information about the author(s) and about the
submission. These files <strong>MUST</strong> pass the checks of <code>chkentry(1)</code>!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>chkentry</code> does not pass and you used <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> it is <strong>very likely</strong> a

Assuming that <code>chkentry(1)</code> successfully validates both <code>.auth.json</code> and

<strong>NOT</strong> form a tarball if there are any issues.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> is used and <code>chkentry(1)</code> fails to validate either of the

unlikely.

<strong>mkiocccentry tools use a <em>clone</em></strong> of the <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse
repo</a> <strong>at a <em>specific</em> release</strong>.
Thus the <code>mkiocccentry</code> will at times be behind the
<a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse repo</a>!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You do <strong>NOT need to install</strong> <code>jparse</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse

In other words, <code>mkiocccentry</code> <strong>contains everything</strong> you need, and <em>even if you

As an important part of its algorithm, <a href="#txzchk">txzchk</a> directly executes <code>fnamchk</code>.
If the filename is invalid (or the filename does not match the

Because <code>txzchk(1)</code> tool uses <code>fnamchk(1)</code> tool as part of its algorithm,

It is extremely unlikely that <code>fnamchk(1)</code> reporting an invalid filename is a
bug in <code>fnamchk(1)</code> and as such, ignoring such an issue risks violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a> which is a big risk. Of course, using <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>
would prevent this from happening as it would not create such a file anyway. If
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> was used it would rather suggest a bug in one of the tools and

As you can see, the use of <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> is <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong>, and at
the risk of stating the obvious, you run <strong>a VERY BIG risk</strong> of having
your submission rejected if you package your own tarball, and there are <strong>ANY
problems</strong>. For instance, if <code>chkentry(1)</code> found a problem in your <code>.info.json</code>
file, the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool would not package it. But if you were to package
it manually, you would be violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>. But even if

<p class="leftbar">
One reason that you might have to change the flags, is that the optimiser is
known to break some programs, but there are certainly other possible valid

For compilers, such as <code>clang</code>, that have the <code>-Weverything</code> option,
while you may wish to try it, you should read our
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">clang -Weverything</a>”.
We do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend that you put
the use of <code>-Weverything</code> into your submission’s <code>Makefile</code> for the reasons
cited there. This goes even if your version does not trigger a warning as some
other version might!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, if <code>${CC}</code> has “<code>clang</code>” in the name, the example <code>Makefile</code> will
automatically enable <code>-Weverything</code>, so you might have to use <code>-Wno-foo</code>
options anyway, as detailed below. See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">-Weverything</a>”
for more details.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If “<code>clang</code>” is NOT in <code>${CC}</code>, the <code>CWARN</code> variable will not be further
modified.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There is no real penalty for compiler warnings. Sometimes
compiler warnings cannot be helped: especially in the case of
obfuscated C. :-) So if you cannot easily get rid of a compiler
warning, try not fret too much.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>LIKE</strong> code that has a minimum of warnings, especially under the
more strict <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode:
</p>
<pre><code>    CWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
The two previous guidelines might be thought by some as being somewhat
contradictory. Isn’t life, and isn’t trying to satisfy “contradictory customer
requirements” all too often like that? :-) Try to minimize warnings if you
can.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you manage to produce very few warnings, or perhaps no warnings at
all under the <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode, then by all means brag about it in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file <strong>AND BE SURE TO TELL US</strong> the OS, OS version, compiler
and compiler version in which you observed this occurring (in case our OS and
compiler produces a different result: so your submission won’t be penalized for
not meeting your claims).
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, some warnings cannot be disabled and are enabled by compilers
without any warning option specified. These are sometimes inevitable in
obfuscated code and even in some non-obfuscated code, and you should not worry
about this, though it might be worth pointing out.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
For instance, some compilers like to warn about use of <code>char *</code>s, which seems to
be dubious, as it obviously can’t (always) be avoided, being a big part of C, so
you should not worry about this either; this is the warning
<code>-Wunsafe-buffer-usage</code> and the way to disable it is <code>-Wno-unsafe-buffer-usage</code>.
See also the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#forced_warnings">forced warnings</a>”

FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">-Weverything</a>”.
</p>
<h2 id="disabling-warnings">Disabling warnings</h2>
<p class="leftbar">
If you do have to disable warnings due to <code>-Weverything</code> automatically being
included, you might wish to state this fact. :-)
And even without <code>-Weverything</code> there can be warnings, as noted above.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If your submission issues lots of warnings but is otherwise
marvelously obfuscated in multiple levels, don’t worry about it. Nevertheless,
be sure that the warnings do not constitute a potential “<strong>show stopper</strong>”
compiler problem. Be sure that compilers such as both <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code> won’t
produce a compiler <strong>error</strong> and refuse to compile your code: unless for some
reason that is what you intend to happen in which case document that too in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file. :-)
</p>
<p>All other things being equal, a program that must turn off fewer
warnings will be considered better, for certain values of better.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To turn off a compiler warning, in your submission’s <code>Makefile</code>,
try something such as:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-some-thing -Wno-another-thing</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-parentheses -Wno-binding-in-condition -Wno-misleading-indentation</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
If you do add “<code>-Wno-foo</code>” to your Makefile, consider changing:
</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN=</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
to:
</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN= -Wno-unknown-warning-option</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Some compilers have reported this as an error, however, and if you have
such a compiler you might want to not add it, or at least note in your
<code>remarks.md</code> which OS, OS version, compiler and compiler version you had the
problem.

<p>Doing masses of <code>#define</code>s to obscure the source has become ‘old’. We

<p>One side effect of the above is that you cannot assume the use

<p>On 2012 July 20, the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> rescinded the encouragement of

<p>Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.

after the minute mark is 60.</p>
<p>The “<strong>how to build</strong>” process (via the <code>Makefile</code> or otherwise) should not be
used to try and get around the size limit. It is one thing to make use of a
several <code>-D</code>s on the compile line to help out, but it is quite another to use
many bytes of <code>-D</code>s in order to try and squeeze the source under the size limit.</p>

<p>We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> C code with trailing control-M’s (<code>\r</code> or <code>\015</code>) that results
in compilation failures. Some non-Unix/non-Linux tools such as
MS Visual C and MS Visual C++ leave trailing control-M’s on lines.
Users of such tools should strip off such control-M’s before submitting
their entries. In some cases tools have a “Save As” option that will
prevent such trailing control-M’s being added.</p>
<p>One should restrict libcurses to portable features found on BSD
or Linux curses.</p>
<p><a href="rules.html#rule13">Rule 13</a> states any C source that fails to compile because of unescaped

It is a very good idea to, in your <code>remarks.md</code> file, tell us why you
think your submission is obfuscated. This is particularly true if
your submission has some very subtle obfuscations that we might
otherwise overlook. <strong>&lt;&lt;– Hint!</strong>
</p>
<p>Anyone can format their code into a dense blob. A really clever
author will try format their submission using a “normal” formatting style
such that at first glance (if you squint and don’t look at the details)
the code might pass for non-obfuscated C. Deceptive comments,
and misleading formatting, in some cases, may be a plus. On the
other hand, a misleading code style requires more source bytes.</p>
<p>If you do elect to use misleading formatting and comments, we
suggest you remark on this point in your <code>remarks.md</code> where you talk
about why you think your submission is obfuscated. On the other hand,
if you are pushing up against the size limits, you may be forced
into creating a dense blob. Such are the trade-offs that obfuscators face!</p>

If your submission <strong>MUST</strong> run only on a 64-bit or 32-bit architecture,

If there are limitations in your submission, you are highly encouraged

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values up <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>.
Attempting to factor larger values will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> might try to factor the value -5, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors positive values up
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor large values will

</blockquote>
<p>However the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> might try to also factor 0, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor values outside

<p>Moreover the might try to also factor 3.5 or 0x7, or Fred, so you want to might state:</p>

<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and

<p>You submission might be better off catching the attempt to factor bogus values

lack such a pet, will insult the pet that you do not have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all other things are equal, a submission with fewer limitations will be judged
better than a submission with lots of limitations. So you might want to code accordingly
and state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission attempts to a factor value of any size provided that the
program is given enough time and memory. If the value is not a proper integer,
the program might insult a fish named Eric.</p>

<p>Legal rule abuse is encouraged to help promote creativity. Rule abuse

<p class="leftbar">

indicate so in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. You <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify

your submission is valid. Humor and/or creativity help plead a case.

<p>We are often asked why the contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and

is that we sometimes make genuine mistakes. But in many cases such
problems, flaws or areas of confusion are deliberate. Changes to
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in response to rule abuses, are done in a minimal
fashion. Often we will deliberately leave behind holes (or introduce
new ones) so that future rule abuse may continue. A clever author
should be able to read them and “drive a truck through the holes” in
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, this contest is a parody of the software
development process. The <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>

contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> process as a parody
of the sometimes tragic mismatch between what a customer (or marketing) wants
and what engineering delivers. Real programmers must face obfuscated and
sometimes conflicting specifications and requirements from marketing, sales,
product management an even from customers themselves on a all too regular basis.
This is one of the reasons why the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and

<h1 id="judging-process">JUDGING PROCESS:</h1>
</div>
<p>Entries are judged by Leonid A. Broukhis and Landon Curt Noll.</p>
<p>Each submission submitted is given a random id number and subdirectory. The
submission files including, but not limited to <code>prog.c</code>, <code>Makefile</code>,
<code>remarks.md</code> as well as any data files that you submit, are all placed under
their own directory and stored and judged from this directory.</p>
<p>Any information about the authors is not read by the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> until
the judging process is complete, and then only from entries that have
won an award. Because we do not read this information for entries that
do not win, we do not know who did not win.</p>
<p>The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
individual. Therefore you <strong>MUST</strong> refrain from putting any information
that reveals your identity in your submission.</p>
<p>Now some people point out that coding style might reveal the information
about the others. However we consider this to be simply circumstantial
and outside the scope of the above paragraph.</p>
<p>Some people, in the past, have attempted to obfuscate their identity by
including comments of famous Internet personalities such as <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey">Peter
Honeyman</a>. The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> are on to this trick
and therefore consider any obfuscated source or data file claiming to be from
Honeyman to not be from Honeyman. This of course creates an interesting paradox
known as the “<strong>obfuscated Peter Honeyman paradox</strong>”. Should Peter Honeyman
actually submit to the IOCCC, he alone is excluded from the above, as we
will likely believe it’s just another attempt at confusion. This <em>guideline</em> is
known as the “<strong>Peter Honeyman is exempt</strong>” <em>guideline</em>.</p>
<p>BTW: None of the entries claiming to be from Peter Honeyman have ever
won an award. So it is theoretically possible that Peter Honeyman
did submit to the IOCCC in the past. In the past, Peter had denied
submitting anything to the IOCCC. Perhaps those entries were
submitted by one of his students?</p>
<p>Hopefully we are <strong>VERY CLEAR</strong> on this point! The rules now strongly state:
<strong>PLEASE <em>DO NOT</em> put a name of an author</strong>, in an obvious way, into your
source code, <code>remarks.md</code>, data files, etc., the above “<strong>Peter Honeyman is
exempt</strong>” notwithstanding.</p>
<p>We seemed to have digressed again … :-) Returning to the judging process:</p>
<p>We prefer to be kept in the dark as much as you are until the final
awards are given. We enjoy the surprise of finding out in the end,
who won and where they are from.</p>
<p>We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
Because the main ‘prize’ of winning is being announced, we make all
attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. We remove all non-winning
files, and shred all related printouts. By tradition, we do not even
reveal the number of entries that we received.</p>

<p>Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. During a round,
the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
not. We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
previous round. Thus, a submission gets at least two readings.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<div id="readings">
<h2 id="judging-readings">JUDGING READINGS:</h2>
</div>
<p>A reading consists of a number of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="leftbar">
reading <code>prog.c</code>, the C source, reviewing the <code>remarks.md</code> information
</p></li>
<li>briefly looking any any supplied data files</li>
<li>passing the source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source</li>
<li>passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>compiling/building the source</li>
<li>running the program</li>
<li>Doing other things that only <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> know about :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>In later rounds, other actions are performed including performing
miscellaneous tests on the source and binary.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
This is the very <strong>guideline</strong> that goes, <strong>BING!</strong>
</p>
<p>Until we reduce the stack of submissions down to about 25 submissions,
submissions are judged on an individual basis. A submission is set aside because it
does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
When the number of submissions thins to about 25 submissions, we begin to form
award categories. Submissions begin to compete with each other for awards.
A submission will often compete in several categories.</p>
<p>The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of submissions
we receive. A typical category list might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>best small one line program</strong> (see above about one line programs)</li>
<li><strong>best small program</strong></li>
<li><strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>most useful obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>best game that is obfuscated</strong></li>
<li><strong>most creatively obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>most deceptive C code</strong> (code with deceptive comments and source code)</li>
<li><strong>best X program</strong> (see <a href="#likes">OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES</a>)</li>
<li><strong>best abuse of ISO C or ANSI C standard</strong> (see above about compilers)</li>
<li><strong>best abuse of the C preprocessor</strong></li>
<li><strong>worst/best abuse of the rules</strong> (or some variation)</li>
<li>(anything else so strange that it deserves an award)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not limit ourselves to this list. For example, a few entries are so
good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.</p>
<p>In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to to about
half that number: declaring those remaining to be winners.</p>
<p>Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
make it. The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
less clear cut.</p>
<p>Sometimes a final round submission is good enough to win, but is beat out by a
similar, but slightly better submission. For this reason, it is sometimes
worthwhile to resubmit an improved version of a submission that failed to win in
a previous year, the next year. This assumes, of course, that the submission is
worth improving in the first place!</p>

With the previous guideline in mind: <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts
for the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> that are <strong>NOT ASSOCIATED
WITH</strong> a submission to the <a href="../index.html">IOCCC</a> may be sent to the
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> via the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3HSNTEL8RQ1M0?ref_=wl_share">IOCCC Amazon wishlist</a>.
It has been shown that receiving <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts provides the
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> with a nice
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a> boost, and happy
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> help make the <a href="../index.html">IOCCC</a> better for everyone. :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#support">support the IOCCC</a>”.
</p>
<p>More often than not, we select a small submission (usually one line) and a
strange/creative layout submission. We sometimes also select a
submission that abuses the <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in an interesting way,
or that stretches the contest <a href="rules.html">rules</a> that while legal, it
nevertheless goes against the <strong>intent</strong> of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Nevertheless, see <a href="rules.html#rule12">Rule 12</a>.
</p>
<p>In the end, we traditionally pick one submission as ‘<strong>best</strong>’. Sometimes such
a submission simply far exceeds any of the other entries. More often, the
‘<strong>best</strong>’ is picked because it does well in a number of categories.</p>
<p>In years past, we renamed the winning submission from <code>prog.c</code> to a
name related to the author(s)’ names. This is no longer done.
Winning source is called <code>prog.c</code>. A compiled binary is called <code>prog</code>.</p>

The <strong>contest_status</strong> in the <a href="../status.json">status.json</a> file will change

The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> will begin to prepare to release the source

The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> will commit the winning source to the

It is pointless to ask the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> how many
submissions we receive. See <a href="../faq.html#how_many">How many submissions do the judges receive for a
given IOCCC?</a>.
</p>
<p>Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines from around the
world. Winners have appeared in books (‘<code>The New Hacker's Dictionary</code>’,
‘<code>Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries</code>’, ‘<code>Pointers On C</code>’, others) and on t-shirts.
More than one winner has been turned into a tattoo!</p>
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="../authors.html">winners</a> receive international fame and flames! :-)</p>
