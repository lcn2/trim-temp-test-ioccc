<h1 id="hints-and-suggestions">HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:</h1>
<p>You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. See
<strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong> for details on how to get previous winners.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
might not be valid entries this year. What <em>was</em> unique and novel one year
<em>might be ‘old’ the next year</em>.</p>
<p>An submission is usually examined in a number of ways. We typically apply
a number of tests to an submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the original source</li>
<li>convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#define</code> <em>and</em> <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>run it through a C beautifier</li>
<li>examine the algorithm</li>
<li>compile it (with flags to enable all warnings)</li>
<li>execute it</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider how your submission looks in each of the above tests.
You should ask yourself if your submission remains obscure after it has been
‘<em>cleaned up</em>’ by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.</p>
<p>Your submission need not pass all of the above tests. In certain
cases, a test is not important. Entries that compete for the
‘<em>strangest/most creative source layout</em>’ need not do as well as
others in terms of their algorithm. On the other hand, given
two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the submission that
does something interesting when you run it.</p>
<p>We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. As such, we leave
the contest open for creative rule interpretation. As in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">real
life</a>
programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
is important. For this reason, we often award ‘<em>Best abuse of the
rules</em>’ or ‘<em>Worst abuse of the rules</em>’ to an submission that illustrates this point
in an ironic way.</p>
<p>We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
to attempt to exploit them. We will award ‘<em>Worst abuse of the rules</em>’ or
‘<em>Best abuse of the rules</em>’ and then plug the hole next year.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Even so, we will attempt to use the smallest plug needed, if not smaller. Or, maybe not. :-)</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> There may be less than 2^7+1 reasons why these <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> seem obfuscated.</p>
<p>Check out your program and be sure that it works. We sometimes make
the effort to debug an submission that has a slight problem, particularly
in or near the final round. On the other hand, we have seen some
of the best entries fall down because they didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We tend to look down on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime
number</a> printer that claims that
16 is a prime number. If you do have a bug, you are better off
documenting it. Noting “<em>this submission sometimes prints the 4th power
of a prime by mistake</em>” would save the above submission. And sometimes,
a strange bug/feature can even help the submission! Of course, a correctly
working submission is best. Clever people will note that 16 might be prime
under certain conditions. Wise people, when submitting something clever
will fully explain such cleverness in their submission’s <code>remarks.md</code> file.</p>
<p>People who are considering to just use some complex mathematical
function or state machine to spell out something such as “<em>hello,
world!</em>” really really, and we do mean really, do need to be more creative.</p>
<p>Ultra-obfuscated programs are, in some cases, easier to
deobfuscate than subtly-obfuscated programs. Consider using
misleading or subtle tricks layered on top of or under an
appropriate level of obfuscation. A clean looking program with
misleading comments and variable names might be a good start.</p>
<p>When programs use VTxxx/ANSI sequences, they should NOT be limited to a
specific terminal brand. Those programs that work in a standard xterm
are considered more portable.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a> (the size rule) refers to the use of the IOCCC size tool called <code>iocccsize(1)</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a> for the <code>iocccsize(1)</code> tool.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> To further clarify <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, we subdivided it into two parts, <strong>2a</strong> and <strong>2b</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The overall size limit (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a>) on <code>prog.c</code> is now <strong>4993 bytes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Your submission must satisfy BOTH the maximum size <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> AND your submission
must satisfy the IOCCC size tool <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> This IOCCC size tool imposes a 2nd limit on C code size (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a>. To check your
code against the 2nd limit of <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, use the -i command line option.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>    ./iocccsize prog.c</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The IOCCC size tool algorithm may be summarized as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    The size tool counts most C reserved words (keyword, secondary,
    and selected preprocessor keywords) as 1.  The size tool counts all
    other octets as 1 excluding ASCII whitespace, and excluding any
    &#39;`;`&#39;, &#39;`{`&#39; or &#39;`}`&#39; followed by ASCII whitespace, and excluding any
    &#39;`;`&#39;, &#39;`{`&#39; or &#39;`}`&#39; octet immediately before the end of file.</code></pre>
<p>ASCII whitespace includes ASCII tab, ASCII space, ASCII newline,
ASCII formfeed, and ASCII carriage return.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> When ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ are within a C string, they may still not be
<strong><code>|</code></strong> counted by the IOCCC size tool. This is a feature, not a bug!</p>
<p>In cases where the above summary and the algorithm implemented by
the IOCCC size tool source code conflict, the algorithm implemented
by the IOCCC size tool source code is preferred by the judges.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> There are at least 2 other reasons for selecting 2503 as the 2nd limit<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> besides the fact that 2503 is a prime. These reasons<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> may be searched for and discovered if you are <a href="https://t5k.org/curios/page.php/2503.html">“Curios!” about 2503</a>. :-)<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> Moreover, 2053 was the number of the kernel disk pack of one of the<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> judge’s BESM-6, and 2503 is a decimal anagram of 2053.</p>
<p>Take note that this secondary limit imposed by the IOCCC size tool
obviates some of the need to <code>#define</code> C reserved words in an effort
to get around the size limits of <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>.</p>
<p>Yes Virginia, <strong>that is a hint</strong>!</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> size was changed from
4096 to 4993: a change that keeps the “2b to 2a” size ratio to a
value similar to the <a href="../faq.html#size_rule">2001-2020 IOCCC era</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We recommend that you use the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example Makefile</a>
from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">IOCCC mkiocccentry repo</a>.
renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course, as the starting point for your submissions
required <code>Makefile</code>. Feel free to modify the Makefile to suit your obfuscated needs.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The rest of these guidelines will assume that you are using some variant of the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example Makefile</a>,
renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We suggest that you compile your submission with a commonly available
<code>-std=gnu17</code> (ISO C 2017 with GNU extensions) C compiler.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Unless you clearly state otherwise in your <code>remarks.md</code> file AND put into your
submission’s <code>Makefile</code>, we will compile using <code>-O3 -std=gnu17</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> It is <strong>OK</strong> to require your submission to not be compiled
using the default <code>-O3 -g3 -std=gnu17</code> settings. Simply explain why
your submission should not be compiled using <code>-O3 -g3 -std=gnu17</code> in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file and adjust your <code>Makefile</code> accordingly.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The use of <code>-std=gnu17</code> does <strong>NOT</strong> imply the use of the <code>gcc</code>
compiler! We often start by compiling using the <strong>clang</strong> C compiler instead.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You may change the standard under which your submission is compiled
by modifying the <code>CSTD</code> Makefile variable. For example, to use <code>c17</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>    CSTD= -std=c17</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> For compilers, such as clang, that have the <code>-Weverything</code> option,
while you try wish it, <strong>HOWEVER</strong> see the <a href="../faq.html#weverything">FAQ about clang -Weverything</a>.
Thus, we do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend that you put the use of <code>-Weverything</code> into
your submission’s <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You may change the level of optimization and compiler debug level
which your submission is compiled by modifying the <code>COPT</code> Makefile variable.
For example, to compile without optimization:</p>
<pre><code>    COPT= -O0 -g3</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> There is no real penalty for compiler warnings. Sometimes
compiler warnings cannot be helped: especially in the case of
obfuscated C. :-) So if you cannot easily get rid of a compiler
warning, try not fret too much.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> To turn off a compiler warning, to your submission’s <code>Makefile</code>,
try something such as:</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-some-thing -Wno-another-thing -Wno-unknown-warning-option</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If you do add “<code>-Wno-some-thing</code>” to your Makefile,
consider also adding <code>-Wno-unknown-warning-option</code> just in case the
warning you use is not available in the compilers we use test your
submission.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If you need to define something on the compile line, use
the <code>CDEFINE</code> Makefile variable. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    CDEFINE= -Dfoo -Dbar=baz</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If need add other “<em>magic</em>” flags to your compile line,
use the <code>COTHER</code> Makefile variable. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    COTHER= -include stdio.h</code></pre>
<h1 id="our-likes-and-dislikes">OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:</h1>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>LIKE</strong> entries that use an edited variant of the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example Makefile</a>,
renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course. This makes it easier for the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a>
to test your submission. And if your submissions wins, integrate it into
the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC winner website</a>.</p>
<p>Doing masses of <code>#defines</code> to obscure the source has become ‘old’. We
tend to ‘see thru’ masses of <code>#defines</code> due to our pre-processor tests
that we apply. Simply abusing <code>#defines</code> or <code>-Dfoo=bar</code> won’t go as far
as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.</p>
<p>Many C compilers <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the following code, and so do we:</p>
<pre><code>    #define d define
    #d foo             /* &lt;-- don&#39;t expect this to turn into #define foo */</code></pre>
<p>When declaring local or global variables, you should declare the type:</p>
<pre><code>    int this_is_fine;
    this_is_not;       /* &lt;-- Try to avoid implicit type declarations */</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>LIKE</strong> code that has a minimum of warnings, especially under the
more strict <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>    CWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code></pre>
<p>All other things being equal, a program that must turn off fewer
warnings will be considered better, for certain values of better.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We tend to <strong>like less</strong> a submission that requires either
<strong>gcc</strong> or <strong>clang</strong>. We prefer submissions that can compile
under both <strong>gcc</strong> and <strong>clang</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>RECOMMEND</strong> that the compiler flags you use in your
submission’s <code>Makefile</code> are supported by both <strong>gcc</strong> and <strong>clang</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of obscure compiler flags, especially
if either <strong>gcc</strong> or <strong>clang</strong> does not support it. We <strong>suggest</strong>
that you not use any really obscure compiler flags if you can help it.</p>
<p>One side effect of the above is that you cannot assume the use
of nested functions such as:</p>
<pre><code>     main() {
|        void please_dont_submit_this() {
|           printf(&quot;The machine that goes BING!!\n&quot;);
         }
|        please_dont_submit_this();
     }</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> On 2012 July 20, the judges rescinded the encouragement of
nested functions. Such constructions, while interesting and sometimes
amusing, will have to wait until they required by a C standard that are
actually implemented in both <strong>gcc</strong> and <strong>clang</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> submissions require the use of <code>-fnested-functions</code>.</p>
<p>We prefer programs that do not require a fish license: crayons and
cat detector vans not withstanding.</p>
<p>If your submission uses functions that have a variable number of
arguments, be careful. Systems implement <code>va_list</code> as a wide variety
of ways. Because of this, a number of operations using <code>va_list</code> are
not portable and must not be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>assigning a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>casting a non-<code>va_list</code> variable into/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>passing a <code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a non-<code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>passing a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a <code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>performing arithmetic on <code>va_list</code> variables</li>
<li>using <code>va_list</code> as a structure or union</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, do not treat <code>va_list</code> variables as if they were a <code>char **</code>s.</p>
<p>Avoid using <code>varargs.h</code>. Use <code>stdarg.h</code> instead.</p>
<p>On 28 January 2007, the Judges rescinded the requirement that the
<code>#</code> in a C preprocessor directive must be the 1st non-whitespace octet.</p>
<p>The <code>exit(3)</code> function returns <code>void</code>. Some broken systems have <code>exit(3)</code>
return <code>int</code>, your submission should assume that <code>exit(3)</code> returns a <code>void</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> This <em>guideline</em> has a change mark at the very start of this line.</p>
<p>Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
serve a useful purpose. They are often the only program that people
attempt to completely understand. For this reason, we look for
programs that are compact, and are instructional.</p>
<p>While those who are used to temperatures found on <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/">dwarf
planet</a>,
(<strong>yes Virginia, dwarf planets are planets</strong>) such as
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/">Pluto</a> might be able to
explain to the Walrus why our seas are boiling hot, the question of
whether pigs have wings is likely to remain a debatable point to most.</p>
<p>One line programs should be short one line programs: say around 80 to 120
octets long. Going well beyond 140 octets is a bit too long to be called
a one-liner in our vague opinion.</p>
<p>We tend to <strong>DISLIKE</strong> programs that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are very hardware specific</li>
<li>are very OS version specific (index/strchr differences are OK, but socket/streams specific code is likely not to be)<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * dump core or have compiler warnings (it is OK only if you warn us in your ‘remark.md’ file)<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * won’t compile or run a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a> environment</li>
<li>depend on a utility or application not normally found systems that conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a></li>
<li>abuse the build file to get around the size limit<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * obfuscate by use of ANSI trigraphs<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * are larger than they need to be<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * have more lines than they need to have<br>
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * are “blob-ier” (just a pile of unformatted C code) than they need to be</li>
<li>are rather similar to <strong>previous winners</strong> :-(</li>
<li>are identical to <strong>previous losers</strong> :-)</li>
<li>that mandate the exclusive the use of an specific Integrated</li>
<li>Development Environment (IDE)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to encourage submission portability, we <strong>DISLIKE</strong> entries that
fail to build unless one is using an IDE. For example, do not
mandate that one must use Microsoft Visual Studio to compile
your submission. Nevertheless some of the better IDEs have command-line
interfaces to their compilers, once one learns how to invoke a shell.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The program must compile and link cleanly in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a> environment Therefore do not assume the system has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows.h">windows.h</a> include file:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;windows.h&gt;        /* we DISLIKE this include */</code></pre>
<p>Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
‘<em>Best one liner</em>’ category, we suggest that you format your program
in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.</p>
<p>At least one judge prefers to maintain the use of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap-second</a>
as part of the world’s time standard. If your code prints time
with seconds, we prefer that your code be capable of printing the
time of day during a leap-second where the value in seconds
after the minute mark is 60.</p>
<p>The “<em>how to build</em>” make process should not be used to try and get
around the size limit. It is one thing to make use of a several <code>-D</code>s
on the compile line to help out, but it is quite another to use many
bytes of <code>-D</code>s in order to try and squeeze the source under the size limit.</p>
<p>Your source code, post-pre-processing, should not exceed the size of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>. :-)</p>
<p>The judges, as a group, have a history giving wide degree of latitude
to reasonable entries. And recently they have had as much longitudinal
variation as it is possible to have on Earth. :-)</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You should try to restrict commands used on the build file to
commands found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a> environments
and systems that conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You may compile and use your own programs. If you do, try to build and execute
from the current directory. This restriction is not a hard and
absolute one. The intent is to ensure that the building if your
program is reasonably portable.</p>
<p>We prefer programs that are portable across a wide variety of Unix-like
operating systems (i.e., Linux, GNU Hurd, BSD, Unix, etc.).</p>
<p>You are in a maze of twisty <em>guidelines</em>, all different.</p>
<p>There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little
or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the building of your program should be done
<strong>WITHOUT human intervention</strong>. So don’t do things such as:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        #echo this next line requires data from standard input
        cat &gt; prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -o prog</code></pre>
<p>However, you can do something cute such as making your program
do something dumb (or cute) when it is built ‘automatically’, and
when it is run with a human involved, do something more clever.
For example, one could use the build instructions:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -DNON_HUMAN_COMPILE -o prog
        @echo &quot;See remarks section about alternate ways to compile&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and then include special notes in tour <code>remarks.md</code> file for
alternate / human intervention based building.</p>
<p>We want to get away from source that is simply a compact blob of
octets. Really try to be more creative than blob coding. <strong>HINT!</strong></p>
<p>Please do not use things like <code>gzip(1)</code> to get around the size limit.
Please try to be much more creative.</p>
<p>We really <strong>DISLIKE</strong> entries that make blatant use of including
large data files to get around the source code size limit.</p>
<p>We do not recommend submitting <a href="https://systemd.io">systemd</a> source code to the IOCCC,
if nothing else because that code is likely to exceed the source code
size limit. This isn’t to say that another highly compact and obfuscated
replacement of <code>init</code> would not be an interesting submission.</p>
<p>Did we remember to indicate that programs that blatantly use
some complex state machine to do something simple are boring?
We think we did. :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All generalizations are false, including this one. – Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
program, we tend to favor the second version. Of course, a third
version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
Remember, you can submit more than one submission. See the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> for details.</p>
<p>We suggest that you avoid trying for the ‘smallest self-replicating’
source. The smallest, a zero byte submission, <a href="../1994/smr/index.html">won in 1994</a>.</p>
<p>Programs that claim to be the smallest C source that does something, really
better be the smallest such program or they risk being rejected because
they do not work as documented.</p>
<p>Please note that the C source below, besides lacking in obfuscation,
is NOT the smallest C source file that when compiled and run, dumps core:</p>
<pre><code>    main;</code></pre>
<p>We do <strong>DISLIKE</strong> writable strings. That is, we don’t want stuff such as:</p>
<pre><code>    char *T = &quot;So many primes, so little time!&quot;;
    ...
    T[14] = &#39;;&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Please don’t make use of this feature, even if your system allows it.
However, initialized char arrays are OK to write over. This is OK:</p>
<pre><code>    char b[] = &quot;Is this OK&quot;;
    b[9] = &#39;K&#39;;</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> There are more than 1 typos in this very sentence.</p>
<p>X client entries should be as portable as possible. Entries that
adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. For
example, don’t depend on a particular type or size of display.
Don’t assume the use of a particular browser. Instead assume a
generic browser that forms to a widely used W3C standard.
Don’t assume a particular sound sub-system or video driver is installed
in the OS. Instead, make use of a well known and widely available open
source program (one that actually works) to display audio/visual data.</p>
<p>X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
software that is not in wide spread use.</p>
<p>This is the only <em>guideline</em> that contains the word fizzbin.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> However, do you know how to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_in_Star_Trek#Fizzbin">fizzbin</a>?
You do?!? (Except on Tuesday?)</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> OK, there are actually 3 <em>guidelines</em> that contain the word fizzbin.</p>
<p>We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> entries that use proprietary toolkits such as the <code>M*tif</code>,
<code>Xv*ew</code>, or <code>OpenL*ok</code> toolkits, since not everyone has them. Use an
open source toolkit that is widely and freely available instead.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The previous <em>guideline</em> in this spot has been replaced by this <em>guideline</em>:</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
<code>.Xdefaults</code>. If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
in the your <code>remarks.md</code> file. They should also not depend on any
particular window manager.</p>
<p>Try to avoid entries that play silent sound segments or play the
Happy Birthday song; music that some people believe is copyrighted
(even if such copyrights appear to be bogus and/or blatant abuses of
the copyright system).</p>
<p>While we recognize that UNIX is not a universal operating system, the
contest does have a bias towards such systems. In an effort to expand
the scope of the contest, we phrase our bias to favor:</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You are <strong>well advised</strong> to submit entries that conform to the <a href="https://unix.org/version4/overview.html">Single UNIX Specification Version 4</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You very well might not be completely be prohibited from failing to not
<strong><code>|</code></strong> partly misunderstand this particular <em>guideline</em>, but of course, we could
<strong><code>|</code></strong> not possibly comment! :-) Nevertheless, you are neither prohibited, nor are
<strong><code>|</code></strong> you fully required to determine that this or the previous sentence is either false
<strong><code>|</code></strong> and/or perhaps misleading. Therefore, it might be wise for you to not fail to consider
<strong><code>|</code></strong> to do so, accordingly. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Any complaints about the above <em>guideline</em> could be addressed to the
Speaker of the House of Commons, or to the speaker of your national
parliament should you have one.</p>
<p>We <strong>LIKE</strong> programs that:</p>
<ul>
<li>are as concise and small as they need to be</li>
<li>do something at least quasi-interesting</li>
<li>are portable</li>
<li>are unique or novel in their obfuscation style</li>
<li>MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION <strong>&lt;== HINT!!</strong></li>
<li>make us laugh and/or throw up :-) (humor really helps!)</li>
<li>make us want to eat good chocolate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some types of programs can’t excel (anti-tm) in some areas. Your
program doesn’t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
areas really does help.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> You are better off explaining what your submission does in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file section rather than leaving it obscure for the judges
as we might miss something and/or be too tired to notice.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Please avoid this specific individual <em>guideline</em>, if it at all possible.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file help your chances of winning. If you had to
read so many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. We do read
the your <code>remarks.md</code> content during the judging process, so it is worth your
while to write remarkable <code>remarks.md</code> file.</p>
<p>We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> C code with trailing control-M’s (<code>\r</code> or <code>\015</code>) that results
in compilation failures. Some non-Unix/non-Linux tools such as
MS Visual C and MS Visual C++ leave trailing control-M’s on lines.
Users of such tools should strip off such control-M’s before submitting
their entries. In some cases tools have a “Save As” option that will
prevent such trailing control-M’s being added.</p>
<p>One should restrict libcurses to portable features found on BSD
or Linux curses.</p>
<p><a href="rules.html#rule13">Rule 13</a> states any C source that fails to compile because of unescaped
octets with the high bit set (octet value &gt;= 128) will be rejected.
Instead of unescaped octets, you should use or escapes:</p>
<pre><code>
              /* 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456 */
    char *foo = &quot;This string is 36 octets in length \263&quot;;
          /* This octet requires 4 octets of source ^^^^ */
    if (strlen(foo) == 36) printf(&quot;foo is 36 octets plus a final NUL\n&quot;);
    else printf(&quot;This code should not print this message\n&quot;);</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> It is a very good idea to, in your <code>remarks.md</code> file, tell us why you
think your submission is obfuscated. This is particularly true if
your submission is has some very subtle obfuscations that we might
otherwise overlook. <strong>&lt;&lt;– Hint!</strong></p>
<p>Anyone can format their code into a dense blob. A really clever
author will try format their submission using a “normal” formatting style
such that at first glance (if you squint and don’t look at the details)
the code might pass for non-obfuscated C. Deceptive comments,
and misleading formatting, in some cases, may be a plus. On the
other hand, a misleading code style requires more source bytes.</p>
<p>If you do elect to use misleading formatting and comments, we
suggest you remark on this point in your remarks where you talk
about why you think your submission is obfuscated. On the other hand,
if you are pushing up against the size limits, you may be forced
into creating a dense blob. Such are the trade-offs that obfuscators face!</p>
<p>We prefer code that can run on either a 64-bit or 32-bit processor.
However, it is unwise to assume it will run on an i386 or x86 architecture.</p>
<p>We believe that Mark Twain’s once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get your facts first, then you can distort them as you please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… is a good motto for those writing code for the IOCCC.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/iocccsize.c">IOCCC size tool source</a>
is not an original work,
unless you are Anthony C Howe, in which case it is original!
Submitting source that uses the content of iocccsize.c, unless you are
Anthony C Howe, might run the risk of violating <a href="rules.html#rule7">Rule 7</a>.</p>
<p><a href="rules.html#rule7">Rule 7</a> does not prohibit you from writing your own obfuscated IOCCC size tool.
However if you do, you might wish to make your tool do something more
interesting than simply implementing the IOCCC size tool algorithm.</p>
<p>While programs that only run in a specific word size are OK. If you have
to pick, choose a 64-bit word size.</p>
<p>If we are feeling ornery we might choose to compile your program
for running on an Arduino or a PDP-11. Heck, should we ever find
an emulator of 60-bit CDC Cyber CPU, we might just try your submission
on that emulator as well :-)</p>
<p>If your submission MUST run only in 32-bit mode on an Intel processor, add the
following compiler flag:</p>
<pre><code>    -arch i386</code></pre>
<p>to your “how to build” make compile line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -arch i386 -o prog</code></pre>
<p>Be even more creative!</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If there are limitations in your submission, you are highly encouraged
to note such limitations in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. For example if your
submission factors values up to a certain size, you might want to state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors values up 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor larger values will produce unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>The judges might try to factor the value -5, so you want to might state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors positive values up 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor large values will produce unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>However the judges might try to also factor 0, so you want to might state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors values between 1 and 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor values outside that range will produce unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>Moreover the try to also factor 3.5 or 0x7, or Fred, so you want to might state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors integers between 1 and 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor anything else will produce unpredictable results.</code></pre>
<p>You submission might be better off catching the attempt to factor bogus values
and doing something interesting. So you might want to code accordingly and state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors integers between 1 and 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor anything else will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric.</code></pre>
<p>The judges might not have a pet fish named Eric, so might want to state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission factors integers between 1 and 2305567963945518424753102147331756070.
    Attempting to factor anything else will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric,
    or in the case that you lack such a pet, will insult the pet that you do not have.</code></pre>
<p>When all other things are equal, an submission with fewer limitations will be judged
better than an submission with lots of limitations. So you might want to code accordingly
and state:</p>
<pre><code>    This submission attempts to a factor value of any size provided that the program is
    given enough time and memory.  If the value is not a proper integer, the program
    might insult a fish named Eric.</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Do not fear if you not 100% sure of the significance of <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code> as it is not of prime importance: or is it? :-)</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of use ASCII tab characters in markdown files, such as in the required <code>remarks.md</code> file.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We don’t mind the use ASCII tab characters in your C code. Feel free to use ASCII tab characters if that suits your obfuscation needs. If is perfectly <strong>OK</strong> to use tab characters elsewhere in your submission, just not in markdown files as this tends complicate and annoys us when be comes to rendering your markdown content.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If you do use ASCII tab characters in your non-markdown files, be aware that some people may use tab stop that is different than the common 8 character tab stop.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> <strong>PLEASE</strong> observe our <a href="../markdown.html">IOCCC markdown guidelines</a> when forming your submission’s <code>remarks.md</code> file. And if your submission contains additional markdown files, please follow those same guidelines. See also <a href="rules.html#rule19">Rule 19</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>LIKE</strong> a reading <code>remarks.md</code> files, especially if they contain useful, informative, and even humorous content about your submission. Yes, this is a <strong>hint</strong>. :-)</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> We <strong>RECOMMEND</strong> you put a reasonable amount effort into the content of the <code>remarks.md</code> file: it is a required for for a reason. :-)</p>
<h1 id="abusing-the-rules">ABUSING THE RULES:</h1>
<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is somewhat encouraged. Legal rule abuse
may involve, but is not limited to, doing things that are technically allowed by
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and yet do not fit the spirit of what we intended to be
submitted.</p>
<p>Legal rule abuse is encouraged to help promote creativity. Rule abuse
entries, regardless of if they receive an award, result in changes to
the next year’s <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is NOT an invitation to violate the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. An submission that violates the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> in the
opinion of the judges, <strong>WILL</strong> be
disqualified. <strong><em>RULE ABUSE CARRIES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK!</em></strong> If you
have an submission that might otherwise be interesting, you might want to
submit two versions; one that does not abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and one that
does.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If you intend to abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>,
indicate so in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. You <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify
why you consider your rule abuse to be allowed under the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. That is, you must plead your case as to why
your submission is valid. Humor and/or creativity help plead a case.
As there is no guarantee that you will succeed, you might consider
submitting an alternate version that conforms to the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> If do bypass the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> warnings about <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a> and/or about <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a>
and submit an submission anyway, you <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify why the IOCCC
judges should not reject your submission due to a rule violation.</p>
<p>Abusing the web submission procedure tends to annoy us more
than amuse us. Spend your creative energy on content of your
submission rather than on the submission process itself.</p>
<p>We are often asked why the contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
<a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> seem too
strange or contain mistakes, flaws or grammatical errors. One reason
is that we sometimes make genuine mistakes. But in many cases such
problems, flaws or areas of confusion are deliberate. Changes to
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in response to rule abuses, are done in a minimal
fashion. Often we will deliberately leave behind holes (or introduce
new ones) so that future rule abuse may continue. A cleaver author
should be able to read them and “drive a truck through the holes” in
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, this contest is a parody of the software
development process. The <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>
are only a small part of the overall contest. Even so, one may think the
contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> process as a parody
of the sometimes tragic mismatch between what a customer (or marketing) wants
and what engineering delivers. Real programmers must face obfuscated and
sometimes conflicting specifications and requirements from marketing, sales,
product management an even from customers themselves on a all too regular basis.
This is one of the reasons why the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
<a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> are written in obfuscated form.</p>
<h1 id="judging-process">JUDGING PROCESS:</h1>
<p>Entries are judged by Leonid A. Broukhis and Landon Curt Noll.</p>
<p>Each submission submitted is given a random id number and subdirectory. The
submission files including, but not limited to prog.c, Makefile (that we
form from around your “how to build” information), as well as any
data files that you submit are all placed under their own directory
stored and judged from this directory.</p>
<p>Any information about the authors is not read by the judges until
the judging process is complete, and then only from entries that have
won an award. Because we do not read this information for entries that
do not win, we do not know who did not win.</p>
<p>The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
individual. Therefore you <strong>MUST</strong> refrain from putting any information
that reveals your identity in your submission.</p>
<p>Now some people point out that coding style might reveal the information
about the others. However we consider this to be simply circumstantial
and outside the scope of the above paragraph.</p>
<p>Some people, in the past, have attempted to obfuscate their identity by
including comments of famous Internet personalities such as <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey">Peter
Honeyman</a>. The judges are on to this trick
and therefore consider any obfuscated source or data file claiming to be from
Honeyman to not be form Honeyman. This of course creates an interesting paradox
known as the “obfuscated Peter Honeyman paradox”. Should Peter Honeyman
actually submit an obfuscated submission, he alone is excluded from the above, as we
will likely believe it just another attempt at confusion. This <em>guideline</em> is
known as the “Peter Honeyman is exempt” <em>guideline</em>.</p>
<p>BTW: None of the entries claiming to be from Peter Honeyman have ever
won an award. So it is theoretically possible that Peter Honeyman
did submit an submission in the past. In the past, Peter had denied
submitting anything to the IOCCC. Perhaps those entries were
submitted by one of his students?</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> Hopefully we are <strong>VERY CLEAR</strong> on this point! The rules now strongly state:
<strong>PLEASE <em>DO NOT</em> put a name of an author</strong>, in an obvious way, into your
source code, <code>remarks.md</code>, data files, etc. The above “Peter Honeyman is
exempt” notwithstanding.</p>
<p>We seemed to have digressed again … :-) Returning to the judging process:</p>
<p>We prefer to be kept in the dark as much as you are until the final
awards are given. We enjoy the surprise of finding out in the end,
who won and where they were from.</p>
<p>We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
Because the main ‘prize’ of winning is being announced, we make all
attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. We remove all non-winning
files, and shred all related paper. By tradition, we do not even
reveal the number of entries that we received.</p>
<p>During the judging process, a process that spans multiple sessions
over a few weeks, post general updates from our <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc">Mastodon
account</a>.</p>
<p>Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. During a round,
the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
not. We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
previous round. Thus, an submission gets at least two readings.</p>
<p>A reading consists of a number of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading the “how to build” information and forming a Makefile</li>
<li>reading prog.c, the C source
<strong><code>|</code></strong> * reviewing the <code>remarks.md</code> information</li>
<li>briefly looking any any supplied data files</li>
<li>passing the source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any #include files</li>
<li>performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source</li>
<li>passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any #include files</li>
<li>compiling/building the source</li>
<li>running the program</li>
<li>Doing other things that only IOCCC judges know about :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>In later rounds, other actions are performed including performing
miscellaneous tests on the source and binary.</p>
<p><strong><code>|</code></strong> This is the very <em>guideline</em> that goes, BING!</p>
<p>Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
are judged on an individual basis. An submission is set aside because it
does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
award categories. Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
An submission will often compete in several categories.</p>
<p>The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
we receive. A typical category list might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>best small one line program (see above about one line programs)</li>
<li>best small program</li>
<li>strangest/most creative source layout</li>
<li>most useful obfuscated program</li>
<li>best game that is obfuscated</li>
<li>most creatively obfuscated program</li>
<li>most deceptive C code (code with deceptive comments and source code)</li>
<li>best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)</li>
<li>best abuse of ISO C or ANSI C standard (see above about compilers)</li>
<li>best abuse of the C preprocessor</li>
<li>worst abuse of the rules</li>
<li>(anything else so strange that it deserves an award)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not limit ourselves to this list. For example, a few entries are so
good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.</p>
<p>In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to to about
half that number: declaring those remaining to be winners.</p>
<p>Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
make it. The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
less clear cut.</p>
<p>Sometimes a final round submission is good enough to win, but is beat out
by a similar, but slightly better submission. For this reason, it is
sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an submission
that failed to win in a previous year. This assumes, of course,
that the submission is worth improving in the first place!</p>
<p>More than one IOCCC judge has been known to bribe another IOCCC judge
into voting for a winning submission by offering a bit high quality chocolate.
This technique is highly discouraged for use by non-IOCCC judges.</p>
<p>More often than not, we select a small submission (usually one line), a
strange/creative layout submission. We sometimes also select an
submission that abuses the <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in an interesting way,
or that stretches the content rules that while legal, is
nevertheless goes against the intent of the rules.</p>
<p>In the end, we traditionally pick one submission as ‘best’. Sometimes such
an submission simply far exceeds any of the other entries. More often, the
‘best’ is picked because it does well in a number of categories.</p>
<p>In years past, we renamed the winning submission from prog.c to a
name related to the submitter(s) names. This is no longer done.
Winning source is called prog.c A compiled binary is called prog.</p>
<h1 id="announcement-of-winners">ANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:</h1>
<p>The judges will toot initial announcement of who won, the name
of their award, and a very brief description of the winning submission
from the <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc"><span class="citation" data-cites="IOCCC">@IOCCC</span> Mastodon account</a>. You should
