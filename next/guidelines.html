<h1 id="hints-and-suggestions">HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:</h1>
</div>
</div>
<p>You are encouraged to examine the <a href="../years.html">winners of previous contests</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <a href="rules.html">rules</a> change from year to year, so some <a href="../years.html">winning
entries</a> might not be valid submissions this year; what <em>was</em> unique
and novel one year <em>might be ‘old’ the next year</em>.</p>
<p>A submission is usually examined in a number of ways. We typically apply
a number of tests to a submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the original source</li>
<li>convert ANSI trigraphs to ASCII</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#define</code> <em>and</em> <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>run it through a C beautifier</li>
<li>examine the algorithm</li>
<li>compile it (with flags to enable all warnings)</li>
<li>execute it</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider how your submission looks in each of the above tests.
You should ask yourself if your submission remains obscure after it has been
‘<em>cleaned up</em>’ by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.</p>
<p>Your submission need not pass all of the above tests. In certain
cases, a test is not important. Entries that compete for the
‘<strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong>’ need not do as well as
others in terms of their algorithm. On the other hand, given
two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the submission that
does something interesting when you run it.</p>
<p>We try to avoid limiting creativity in our <a href="rules.html">rules</a>. As such, we
leave the contest open for creative rule interpretation. As in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">real
life</a> programming, interpreting a
requirements document or a customer request is important. For this reason, we
often award ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some variation to a submission that illustrates this
point in an ironic way.</p>
<p>We do realize that there are holes in the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>, and invite
entries to attempt to exploit them. We will award ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some
variation and then plug the hole next year.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When we do need to plug a hole in the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> or <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a>, we will attempt to use a very small plug, if not
smaller. Or, maybe not. :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There may be less than 2^7+1 reasons why these <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a> seem obfuscated.
</p>
<p>Check out your program and be sure that it works. We sometimes make
the effort to debug a submission that has a slight problem, particularly
in or near the final round. On the other hand, we have seen some
of the best entries fall down because they didn’t work.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We tend to look down on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime
number</a> printer that claims that
16 is a prime number. If you do have a bug, you are better off
documenting it. Noting “<em>this submission sometimes prints the 4th power
of a prime by mistake</em>” would save the above submission. And sometimes,
a strange bug/feature can even help the submission! Of course, a correctly
working submission is best. Clever people will note that 16 might be prime
under certain conditions. Wise people, when submitting something clever
will fully explain such cleverness in their submission’s <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p>People who are considering to just use some complex mathematical
function or state machine to spell out something such as “<em>hello,
world!</em>” <strong>really really, <em>and we do mean REALLY</em>, do need to be more creative</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultra-obfuscated programs are, in some cases, easier to
deobfuscate than subtly-obfuscated programs. Consider using
misleading or subtle tricks layered on top of or under an
appropriate level of obfuscation. A clean looking program with
misleading comments and variable names might be a good start.</p>
<p>When programs use VTxxx/ANSI sequences, they should NOT be limited to a
specific terminal brand. Those programs that work in a standard xterm
are considered more portable.</p>

<a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a> (the size rule) refers to the use of the IOCCC size
tool called <code>iocccsize(1)</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry
repo</a> for the <code>iocccsize(1)</code> tool.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To further clarify <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, we subdivided it into two parts,
<strong>2a</strong> and <strong>2b</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The overall size limit (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a>) on <code>prog.c</code> is now <strong>4993 bytes</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Your submission must satisfy BOTH the maximum size <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a> <strong>AND</strong> the IOCCC size tool <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
This IOCCC size tool imposes a 2nd limit on C code size (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a>). To check your code against <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>    iocccsize prog.c</code></pre>
<p>The IOCCC size tool algorithm may be summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size tool counts most C reserved words (keyword, secondary, and selected
preprocessor keywords) as 1. The size tool counts all other octets as 1
excluding ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ followed by
ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ octet immediately
before the end of file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ASCII whitespace includes ASCII tab, ASCII space, ASCII newline,
ASCII formfeed, and ASCII carriage return.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ are within a C string, they may still not be
counted by the IOCCC size tool. This is a <em>feature</em>, not a bug!
</p>
<p>In cases where the above summary and the algorithm implemented by
the IOCCC size tool source code conflict, the algorithm implemented
by the IOCCC size tool source code is preferred by the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There are at least 2 other reasons for selecting 2503 as the 2nd limit besides
the fact that 2503 is a prime. These reasons may be searched for and discovered
if you are <a href="https://t5k.org/curios/page.php/2503.html">“Curios!” about 2503</a>.
:-) Moreover, 2053 was the number of the kernel disk pack of one of the judge’s
BESM-6, and 2503 is a decimal anagram of 2053.
</p>
<p>Take note that this secondary limit imposed by the IOCCC size tool
obviates some of the need to <code>#define</code> C reserved words in an effort
to get around the size limits of <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>.</p>
<p>Yes Virginia, <strong>that is a hint</strong>!</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> size was changed from
4096 to 4993: a change that keeps the “2b to 2a” size ratio to a
value similar to the <a href="../faq.html#size_rule2001-2012">2001-2012</a> and
<a href="../faq.html#size_rule2013-2020">2013-2020</a> IOCCC eras.

<a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a> (the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> rule) states that
you <strong>MUST</strong> use the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool to package your submission tarball.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>
for the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool and below for more details.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry</code> runs a number of checks, by the tool itself and by executing other
tools, <em>before</em> packaging your xz compressed tarball. Once the tarball is
packaged it will run <code>txzchk(1)</code>, which runs <code>fnamchk(1)</code> as part of its
algorithm.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>mkiocccentry</code> encounters an <strong>error</strong> the program will exit and the xz
compressed tarball <strong>will not be formed</strong>. For instance, if <code>chkentry(1)</code> (see
below) fails to validate the <code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code>
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> files that <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> creates,
it is an error and possibly a bug that you should <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report as a bug at the

about reporting bugs in the mkiocccentry repo</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
However, just because there are errors <strong>does not</strong> mean it is a bug in the
code. It might be an issue with your submission. Thus if you report an error as
a bug it might not be something that will be fixed as there might not be
anything wrong.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, some conditions are <strong>warnings</strong> and it allows you to
override these, if you wish. If you’re brave enough you can use the <code>-W</code> option
to ignore all warnings but this is a big risk; the <code>-y</code> option will assume
‘<em>yes</em>’ to most questions but this is also a big risk. Needless to say, we do
NOT recommend these options.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In many places it will prompt you to verify what you input, allowing you to
correct details as you go along.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Although the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool will verify everything for you, you may wish
to validate different parts individually with the different tools. As the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a> state, each of these tools has a <code>-h</code> option. However, to
help simplify matters, we give you a brief overview below, which should also
help you understand some of the checks the tool makes.
</p>
<div id="mkiocccentry-synopsis">
<h2 id="mkiocccentry1-synopsis"><code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> synopsis</h2>
</div>
<p class="leftbar">
The synopsis of the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool is:
</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry [options] work_dir prog.c \
         Makefile remarks.md [file ...]</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
… where <code>work_dir</code> is a directory that will be used to build the submission
tarball, <code>prog.c</code> is your submission source code, <code>Makefile</code> is your submission’s
<code>Makefile</code>, <code>remarks.md</code> are your remarks (that will be the basis of the
<code>README.md</code> file which will be used to form the <code>index.html</code> file, if your
submission wins) and the remaining args are the paths to any other files you
wish to submit.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="rules.html">Rules</a> and in particular <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a> for
the requirements of these files.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <code>work_dir</code> <strong>MUST</strong> already exist, as a directory, and it is an error if it
is not a directory that can be written to. In <strong>this</strong> directory your <strong>submission
directory</strong> will be created, with the name based on your IOCCC registration
username, which is <strong>in the form of a UUID</strong> and submission number; see the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a> for more details on this, and in particular <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If the <strong><em>subdirectory</em> in the <em>work directory</em></strong> already exists, you will have to
move it, remove it or otherwise specify a different work directory (<strong>NOT</strong>
subdirectory), as it needs to be empty and the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool does not
check this for you as it could not do anything about anyway. This <em>subdirectory is
where your files will be <strong>copied</strong> to</em>. Your <em>submission tarball</em> (which you will
upload to the submit server) that <code>txzchk(1)</code> will validate <em>will be placed in
the <strong>work directory</strong></em>, and <strong>its <em>contents</em> will be the <em>subdirectory</em> with your
submission’s files</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool will ask you for information about your
submission <em>as well as author details</em> (that will only be looked at if the
submission wins), run some tests and run a number of other tools, as already
mentioned and as described below.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To help you with editing a submission, the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool has
some options to write <em>OR</em> read from an answers file so you do not have to input
the information about the author(s) and the submission itself, after saving the
answers to a file. To write to <code>answers.txt</code> try:
</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry -a answers.txt ...</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Alternatively, if you wish to overwrite a file, you can use the <code>-A</code>
flag with the same option argument. Be <strong>very careful</strong> that you do not accidentally
overwrite your <code>prog.c</code> or some other important file!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To make use of the answers file, use the <code>-i answers</code> option like:
</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry -i answers.txt ...</code></pre>
<h3 id="mkiocccentry-checks"><code>mkiocccentry</code> checks</h3>

Below are the tools that <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will run.
</p>
<h2 id="iocccsize"><code>iocccsize</code></h2>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will use code from <code>iocccsize(1)</code> which
detects a number of issues that you may ignore, if you wish, as described above.
As we already discussed how to invoke this we will not include it here again.
</p>
<h2 id="chkentry"><code>chkentry</code></h2>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will write two JSON files: <code>.auth.json</code> and
<code>.info.json</code>. These files contain information about the author(s) and about the
submission. These files <strong>MUST</strong> pass the checks of <code>chkentry(1)</code>. If it does
not pass and you used <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> it is very possibly a bug and you should
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report
it as a bug at the mkiocccentry issues
page</a>.
See the <a href="../faq.html#mkiocccentry_bugs">the FAQ about reporting
bugs in the mkiocccentry repo</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Assuming that <code>chkentry(1)</code> validates both <code>.auth.json</code> and
<code>.info.json</code> then the tarball will be formed and then <code>txzchk(1)</code> will be
executed. In this case, there should be no problems as <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> should
<strong>NOT</strong> form a tarball if there are any issues.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you want to validate the <code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code> files you
should use <code>chkentry(1)</code>. <code>chkentry(1)</code> accepts more than one command line form.
If you pass a single argument, it is expected to be a directory that has both
<code>.auth.json</code> and <code>.info.json</code> in it. You can also specify a <code>.auth.json</code> and/or
<code>.info.json</code> file. An argument of <code>.</code> will skip that file. For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>    # test entry directory test_work:
    chkentry test_work

    # run checks on .info.json:
    chkentry .info.json .

    # run checks on .auth.json:
    chkentry . .auth.json

    # run checks on .info.json and .auth.json:
    chkentry .info.json .auth.json</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
If there is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> issue detected
by <code>jparse(8)</code>, <strong>then there is a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a>
error and <code>chkentry(1)</code> will report it as an <em>error</em></strong>. If the parsing is OK <strong>but
there <em>is an issue</em> in one or both of the
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> files in <em>the context of the IOCCC</em>,
it will report this as an error</strong>. Thus, if you were to package this manually
then you would be violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="txzchk"><code>txzchk</code></h2>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>txzchk(1)</code> performs a wide number of sanity checks on the xz
compressed tarball; if any issues are found (‘<code>feathers are stuck in the tarball</code>’ :-) ) <strong>AND if and <em>ONLY IF</em> you used

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
As part of its sanity checks, <code>txzchk(1)</code> will run <code>fnamchk(1)</code> on the
<em>filename</em> to verify that the name is valid.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
It is extremely unlikely that <code>fnamchk(1)</code> reporting an invalid filename is a
bug in <code>fnamchk(1)</code> and as such, ignoring such an issue risks violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a> which is a big risk. Of course, using <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>
would prevent this from happening as it would not create such a file anyway. If
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> was used it would rather suggest a bug in one of the tools and
you should <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report it as a bug at the mkiocccentry issues

repo</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If verbosity level is &gt; 0, <code>txzchk(1)</code> will show the contents of the tarball which is
how the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> shows you the tarball contents for you to review.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss the many tests that
<code>txzchk(1)</code> do. In this case we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/txzchk.c">source
code</a> or the man
page. You might find a fun option if you do either of these!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you wish to validate the tarball without running the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool,
for instance the tarball <code>submit.12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab-2.1720636351.txz</code> you can
do:
</p>

<p class="leftbar">
Assuming that the tarball exists and is valid, you should see no output.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you wish to see the contents, for instance like <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> does, you
could do:

Assuming everything is OK, it would show:
</p>

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
At the risk of stating the obvious: you run <strong>a very big risk</strong> of having
your submission rejected if you package your own tarball and there are <strong>any
problems</strong>. For instance, if <code>chkentry(1)</code> found a problem in your <code>.info.json</code>
file, the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool would not package it. But if you were to package
it manually, you would be violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>. But even if
everything checks out OK you should not expect that everything <strong>IS</strong> OK.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
As you can see, the use of <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> is <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<p>We recommend that you use the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example
Makefile</a>
from the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">IOCCC mkiocccentry repo</a>,
renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course, as the starting point for your submission’s
required <code>Makefile</code>. Feel free to modify the <code>Makefile</code> to suit your obfuscated
needs.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The rest of these guidelines will assume that you are using some variant of the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example Makefile</a>,
renamed as <code>Makefile</code> of course.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We suggest that you compile your submission with a commonly available
<code>-std=gnu17</code> (ISO C 2017 with GNU extensions) C compiler.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Unless you <strong>clearly state</strong> otherwise in your <code>remarks.md</code> file AND put into your
submission’s <code>Makefile</code>, we will compile using <code>-std=gnu17 -O3 -g3</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
It is <strong>OK</strong> to require your submission to not be compiled
using the default <code>-std=gnu17 -O3 -g3</code> settings. Simply explain why
your submission should not be compiled using <code>-std=gnu17 -O3 -g3</code> in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file and adjust your <code>Makefile</code> accordingly.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The use of <code>-std=gnu17</code> does <strong>NOT</strong> imply the use of the <code>gcc</code>
compiler! We often start by compiling using the <strong>clang</strong> C compiler instead.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You may change the standard under which your submission is compiled
by modifying the <code>CSTD</code> Makefile variable. For example, to use <code>c17</code> instead:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSTD= -std=c17</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
For compilers, such as <code>clang</code>, that have the <code>-Weverything</code> option,
while you may wish to try it, you should look at <a href="../faq.html#weverything">the FAQ about clang
-Weverything</a>. We do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend that you put
the use of <code>-Weverything</code> into your submission’s <code>Makefile</code> for the reasons
cited there. This goes even if your version does not trigger a warning as some
other version might!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You may change the level of optimization and compiler debug level
that your submission is compiled with, by modifying the <code>OPT</code> Makefile variable.
For example, to compile without optimization and debug symbols:
</p>
<pre><code>    OPT= -O0 -g3</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
There is no real penalty for compiler warnings. Sometimes
compiler warnings cannot be helped: especially in the case of
obfuscated C. :-) So if you cannot easily get rid of a compiler
warning, try not fret too much.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>LIKE</strong> code that has a minimum of warnings, especially under the
more strict <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode:
</p>
<pre><code>    CWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
The two previous guidelines may be thought by some as being somewhat
contradictory. Isn’t life, and isn’t trying to satisfy “contradictory customer
requirements” all too often like that? :-) Try to minimize warnings if you
can.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you manage to produce very few warnings, or perhaps no warnings at
all under the <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode, then by all means brag about it in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file <strong>AND BE SURE TO TELL US</strong> the OS, OS version, compiler
and compiler version in which you observed this occurring (in case our OS and
compiler produces a different result: so your submission won’t be penalized for
not meeting your claims).
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If your submission issues lots of warnings but is otherwise
marvelously obfuscated in multiple levels, don’t worry about it. Nevertheless,
be sure that the warnings do not constitute a potential “<strong>show stopper</strong>”
compiler problem. Be sure that compilers such as both <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code> won’t
produce a compile <strong>error</strong> and refuse to compile your code: unless for some
reason that is what you intend to happen in which case document that too in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file. :-)
</p>
<p>All other things being equal, a program that must turn off fewer
warnings will be considered better, for certain values of better.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To turn off a compiler warning, in your submission’s <code>Makefile</code>,
try something such as:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-some-thing -Wno-another-thing -Wno-unknown-warning-option</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
<p>If you do add “<code>-Wno-some-thing</code>” to your Makefile, consider changing:</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN=</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN= -Wno-unknown-warning-option</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Some compilers have reported this as an error, however, and if you have
such a compiler you might want to not add it and note it in your <code>remarks.md</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you need to define something on the compile line, use
the <code>CDEFINE</code> Makefile variable. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    CDEFINE= -Dfoo -Dbar=baz</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
If you need to include a file on the command line, use
the <code>CINCLUDE</code> Makefile variable. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    CINCLUDE= -include stdio.h</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
If you need to add other “<strong>magic</strong>” flags to your compile line,
use the <code>COTHER</code> Makefile variable. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    COTHER= -fno-math-errno</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: <strong>We only recommend using “<em>magic</em>” flags if <em>BOTH</em> <code>gcc</code>
<em>and</em> <code>clang</code></strong> support it.

<p>Doing masses of <code>#define</code>s to obscure the source has become ‘old’. We
tend to ‘see thru’ masses of <code>#define</code>s due to our pre-processor tests
that we apply. Simply abusing <code>#define</code>s or <code>-Dfoo=bar</code> won’t go as far
as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Many</strong> C compilers <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the following code, and so do we:</p>
<pre><code>    #define d define
    #d foo             /* &lt;-- don&#39;t expect this to turn into #define foo */</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, it is a compilation error.

<p>When declaring local or global variables, you should declare the type:</p>

<p class="leftbar">
We tend to <strong>like <em>less</em></strong> a submission that requires either

under <strong>BOTH</strong> <code>gcc</code> <strong>AND</strong> <code>clang</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>RECOMMEND</strong> that the compiler flags you use in your

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of obscure compiler flags, especially

<p>One side effect of the above is that you cannot assume the use
of nested functions such as:</p>

     }</code></pre>
<p>On 2012 July 20, the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> rescinded the encouragement of
nested functions. Such constructions, while interesting and sometimes
amusing, will have to wait until they required by a C standard that are
actually implemented in <strong>BOTH</strong> <code>gcc</code> <strong>AND</strong> <code>clang</code>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> submissions that require the use of <code>-fnested-functions</code>.
</p>
<p>We prefer programs that do not require a fish license: crayons and
cat detector vans not withstanding.</p>
<p>If your submission uses functions that have a variable number of
arguments, <strong>be careful</strong>. Systems implement <code>va_list</code> in a wide variety
of ways. Because of this, a number of operations using <code>va_list</code> <strong>are
not portable and <em>must not</em> be used</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>assigning a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>casting a non-<code>va_list</code> variable into/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>passing a <code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a non-<code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>passing a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a <code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>performing arithmetic on <code>va_list</code> variables</li>
<li>using <code>va_list</code> as a structure or union</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, do not treat <code>va_list</code> variables as if they were a <code>char **</code>s.</p>

We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of <code>varargs.h</code>. Use <code>stdarg.h</code> instead.

<p>On 28 January 2007, the Judges rescinded the requirement that the

<p>The <code>exit(3)</code> function returns <code>void</code>. Some broken systems have <code>exit(3)</code>

This <em>guideline</em> has a change mark at the very start of this line.

<p>Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
serve a useful purpose: they are often the only program that people
attempt to completely understand. For this reason, we look for
programs that are compact, and are instructional.</p>

While those who are used to temperatures found on <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/">dwarf

(<strong>yes Virginia, dwarf planets <em>ARE</em> planets!</strong>), such as
<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/dwarf-planets/pluto/">Pluto</a>, might be able to
explain to the Walrus why our seas are boiling hot, the question of
whether pigs have wings is likely to remain a debatable point to most.
</p>
<p>One line programs should be short one line programs: say around 80 to 120
octets long. Going well beyond 140 octets is a bit too long to be called
a one-liner in our vague opinion.</p>
<p>We tend to <strong>DISLIKE</strong> programs that:</p>
<ul>

<p>In order to encourage submission portability, we <strong>DISLIKE</strong> entries that
fail to build unless one is using an IDE. For example, do not
mandate that one must use Microsoft Visual Studio to compile
your submission. Nevertheless some of the better IDEs have command-line
interfaces to their compilers, once one learns how to invoke a shell.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The program must compile and link cleanly in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX
Specification</a>
environment. Therefore do not assume the system has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows.h">windows.h</a> include file:
</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;windows.h&gt;  /* we DISLIKE this */</code></pre>
<p>Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
‘<strong>Best one liner</strong>’ category, we suggest that you format your program
in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.</p>
<p>At least one judge prefers to maintain the use of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap-second</a>
as part of the world’s time standard. If your code prints time
with seconds, we prefer that your code be capable of printing the
time of day during a leap-second where the value in seconds
after the minute mark is 60.</p>
<p>The “<strong>how to build</strong>” process (via the <code>Makefile</code> or otherwise) should not be
used to try and get around the size limit. It is one thing to make use of a
several <code>-D</code>s on the compile line to help out, but it is quite another to use
many bytes of <code>-D</code>s in order to try and squeeze the source under the size limit.</p>
<p>Your source code, post-pre-processing, should not exceed the size of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. :-)</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Other windows, on the other hand, might be OK: especially where “<strong>X

“unseen” (i.e., not dirty). :-)

<p>The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a>, as a group, have a history giving wide degree of latitude

You should try to restrict commands used in the build file to
commands found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a> environments
and systems that conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You may compile and use your own programs. If you do, try to build and execute
from the current directory. This restriction is not a hard and
absolute one. The intent is to ensure that the building if your
program is reasonably portable.
</p>
<p>We prefer programs that are portable across a wide variety of Unix-like
operating systems (e.g., Linux, GNU Hurd, BSD, Unix, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are in a maze of twisty <em>guidelines</em>, all different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are at least zero <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> who think that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism">Fideism</a> has little
or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the building of your program should be done
<strong>WITHOUT human intervention</strong>. So don’t do things such as:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        #echo this next line requires data from standard input
        cat &gt; prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -o prog</code></pre>
<p>However, you can do something cute such as making your program
do something dumb (or cute) when it is built ‘automatically’, and
when it is run with a human involved, do something more clever.
For example, one could put in their <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -DNON_HUMAN_COMPILE -o prog
        @echo &quot;See remarks section about alternate ways to compile&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and then include special notes in their <code>remarks.md</code> file for
alternate / human intervention based building.</p>
<p>We want to get away from source that is simply a compact blob of
octets. Really try to be more creative than blob coding. <strong>HINT!</strong></p>
<p>Please do not use things like <code>gzip(1)</code> to get around the size limit.
Please try to be much more creative.</p>
<p>We really <strong>DISLIKE</strong> entries that make blatant use of including
large data files to get around the source code size limit.</p>
<p>We do not recommend submitting <a href="https://systemd.io">systemd</a> source code to the IOCCC,
if nothing else because that code is likely to exceed <a href="rules.html#rule2">the source code
size limit</a>. This isn’t to say that another highly compact and obfuscated
replacement of <code>init</code> would not be an interesting submission.</p>
<p>Did we remember to indicate that programs that blatantly use
some complex state machine to do something simple are boring?
We think we did. :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All generalizations are false, including this one. – Mark Twain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
program, we tend to favor the second version. Of course, a third
version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
Remember, you can submit more than one submission. See the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC
rules</a> for details (in particular, <a href="rules.html#rule9">Rule 9</a>).</p>
<p>We suggest that you avoid trying for the ‘<strong>smallest self-replicating</strong>’
source. The smallest, a <a href="../1994/smr/index.html">zero byte entry</a>, won in
<a href="../years.html#1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Programs that claim to be the smallest C source that does something, really
better be the smallest such program or they risk being rejected because
they do not work as documented.</p>
<p>Please note that the C source below, besides lacking in obfuscation,
is NOT the smallest C source file that when compiled and run, dumps core:</p>
<pre><code>    main;</code></pre>

Unless you specify <code>-fwritable-strings</code> (see <code>COTHER</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example

<pre><code>    char *T = &quot;So many primes, so little time!&quot;;
    ...
    T[14] = &#39;;&#39;;    /* modifying a string requires: -fwritable-strings */</code></pre>

Initialized char arrays are OK to write over. For instance, this is OK:

<pre><code>    char b[] = &quot;Is this OK&quot;;
    b[9] = &#39;k&#39;;     /* modifying an initialized char array is OK */</code></pre>

It is a very good idea to, in your <code>remarks.md</code> file, tell us why you
think your submission is obfuscated. This is particularly true if
your submission has some very subtle obfuscations that we might
otherwise overlook. <strong>&lt;&lt;– Hint!</strong>
</p>
<p>Anyone can format their code into a dense blob. A really clever
author will try format their submission using a “normal” formatting style
such that at first glance (if you squint and don’t look at the details)
the code might pass for non-obfuscated C. Deceptive comments,
and misleading formatting, in some cases, may be a plus. On the
other hand, a misleading code style requires more source bytes.</p>
<p>If you do elect to use misleading formatting and comments, we
suggest you remark on this point in your <code>remarks.md</code> where you talk
about why you think your submission is obfuscated. On the other hand,
if you are pushing up against the size limits, you may be forced
into creating a dense blob. Such are the trade-offs that obfuscators face!</p>

We prefer code that can run on either a 64-bit or 32-bit

<p class="leftbar">
If your submission <strong>MUST</strong> run only on a 64-bit or 32-bit architecture,
then you <strong>MUST</strong> specify the <code>-arch</code> on your command line
(see <code>ARCH</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/Makefile.example">example

</p>
<pre><code>    ARCH= -m64</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Note, however, that some platforms will not necessarily support some
architectures. For instance, more recent versions of <code>macOS</code> do <strong>NOT</strong> support
32-bit!
</p>
<p>Try to be even more creative!</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If there are limitations in your submission, you are highly encouraged
to note such limitations in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. For example if your
submission factors values up to a certain size, you might want to state:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values up <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>.
Attempting to factor larger values will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> might try to factor the value -5, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors positive values up
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor large values will
produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> might try to also factor 0, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor values outside
that range will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover the might try to also factor 3.5 or 0x7, or Fred, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor anything else
will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You submission might be better off catching the attempt to factor bogus values
and doing something interesting. So you might want to code accordingly and state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>.
Attempting to factor anything else will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> might not have a pet fish named Eric, so you might want to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor anything else
will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric, or in the case that you
lack such a pet, will insult the pet that you do not have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all other things are equal, a submission with fewer limitations will be judged
better than a submission with lots of limitations. So you might want to code accordingly
and state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission attempts to a factor value of any size provided that the
program is given enough time and memory. If the value is not a proper integer,
the program might insult a fish named Eric.</p>

<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is somewhat encouraged. Legal rule abuse
may involve, but is not limited to, doing things that are technically allowed by
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and yet do not fit the spirit of what we intended to be
submitted.</p>
<p>Legal rule abuse is encouraged to help promote creativity. Rule abuse
entries, regardless of if they receive an award, result in changes to
the next year’s <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is <strong>NOT</strong> an invitation to violate the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. A submission that violates the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> in the
opinion of the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a>, <strong>WILL</strong> be
disqualified. <strong><em>RULE ABUSE CARRIES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK!</em></strong> If you
have a submission that might otherwise be interesting, you might want to
submit two versions; one that does not abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and one that
does.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you intend to abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>,
indicate so in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. You <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify
why you consider your rule abuse to be allowed under the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. That is, you must plead your case as to why
your submission is valid. Humor and/or creativity help plead a case.
As there is no guarantee that you will succeed, you might consider
submitting an alternate version that conforms to the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>.

and submit a submission anyway, you <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify why the IOCCC
<a href="../judges.html">judges</a> should not reject your submission due to a rule violation.
</p>
<p>Abusing the web submission procedure tends to annoy us more
than amuse us. Spend your creative energy on content of your
submission rather than on the submission process itself.</p>
<p>We are often asked why the contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
<a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> seem too
strange or contain mistakes, flaws or grammatical errors. One reason
is that we sometimes make genuine mistakes. But in many cases such
problems, flaws or areas of confusion are deliberate. Changes to
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in response to rule abuses, are done in a minimal
fashion. Often we will deliberately leave behind holes (or introduce
new ones) so that future rule abuse may continue. A clever author
should be able to read them and “drive a truck through the holes” in
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, this contest is a parody of the software
development process. The <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>
are only a small part of the overall contest. Even so, one may think the
contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> process as a parody
of the sometimes tragic mismatch between what a customer (or marketing) wants
and what engineering delivers. Real programmers must face obfuscated and
sometimes conflicting specifications and requirements from marketing, sales,
product management an even from customers themselves on a all too regular basis.
This is one of the reasons why the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
<a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> are written in obfuscated form.</p>
<div id="judging">
<h1 id="judging-process">JUDGING PROCESS:</h1>
</div>
<p>Entries are judged by Leonid A. Broukhis and Landon Curt Noll.</p>
<p>Each submission submitted is given a random id number and subdirectory. The
submission files including, but not limited to <code>prog.c</code>, <code>Makefile</code>,
<code>remarks.md</code> as well as any data files that you submit, are all placed under
their own directory and stored and judged from this directory.</p>
<p>Any information about the authors is not read by the <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> until
the judging process is complete, and then only from entries that have
won an award. Because we do not read this information for entries that
do not win, we do not know who did not win.</p>
<p>The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
individual. Therefore you <strong>MUST</strong> refrain from putting any information
that reveals your identity in your submission.</p>
<p>Now some people point out that coding style might reveal the information
about the others. However we consider this to be simply circumstantial
and outside the scope of the above paragraph.</p>
<p>Some people, in the past, have attempted to obfuscate their identity by
including comments of famous Internet personalities such as <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey">Peter
Honeyman</a>. The <a href="../judges.html">judges</a> are on to this trick
and therefore consider any obfuscated source or data file claiming to be from
Honeyman to not be from Honeyman. This of course creates an interesting paradox
known as the “<strong>obfuscated Peter Honeyman paradox</strong>”. Should Peter Honeyman
actually submit to the IOCCC, he alone is excluded from the above, as we
will likely believe it’s just another attempt at confusion. This <em>guideline</em> is
known as the “<strong>Peter Honeyman is exempt</strong>” <em>guideline</em>.</p>
<p>BTW: None of the entries claiming to be from Peter Honeyman have ever
won an award. So it is theoretically possible that Peter Honeyman
did submit to the IOCCC in the past. In the past, Peter had denied
submitting anything to the IOCCC. Perhaps those entries were
submitted by one of his students?</p>
<p>Hopefully we are <strong>VERY CLEAR</strong> on this point! The rules now strongly state:
<strong>PLEASE <em>DO NOT</em> put a name of an author</strong>, in an obvious way, into your
source code, <code>remarks.md</code>, data files, etc., the above “<strong>Peter Honeyman is
exempt</strong>” notwithstanding.</p>
<p>We seemed to have digressed again … :-) Returning to the judging process:</p>
<p>We prefer to be kept in the dark as much as you are until the final
awards are given. We enjoy the surprise of finding out in the end,
who won and where they are from.</p>
<p>We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
Because the main ‘prize’ of winning is being announced, we make all
attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. We remove all non-winning
files, and shred all related printouts. By tradition, we do not even
reveal the number of entries that we received.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
During the judging process, a process that spans multiple sessions over
a few weeks, we post general updates from our <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc">Mastodon

<div id="rounds">
<h2 id="judging-rounds">JUDGING ROUNDS:</h2>
</div>
<p>Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. During a round,
the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
not. We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
previous round. Thus, a submission gets at least two readings.</p>
<div id="readings">
<h2 id="judging-readings">JUDGING READINGS:</h2>
</div>
<p>A reading consists of a number of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="leftbar">
reading <code>prog.c</code>, the C source, reviewing the <code>remarks.md</code> information
</p></li>
<li>briefly looking any any supplied data files</li>
<li>passing the source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source</li>
<li>passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>compiling/building the source</li>
<li>running the program</li>
<li>Doing other things that only <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> know about :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>In later rounds, other actions are performed including performing
miscellaneous tests on the source and binary.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
This is the very <strong>guideline</strong> that goes, <strong>BING!</strong>
</p>
<p>Until we reduce the stack of submissions down to about 25 submissions,
submissions are judged on an individual basis. A submission is set aside because it
does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
When the number of submissions thins to about 25 submissions, we begin to form
award categories. Submissions begin to compete with each other for awards.
A submission will often compete in several categories.</p>
<p>The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of submissions
we receive. A typical category list might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>best small one line program</strong> (see above about one line programs)</li>
<li><strong>best small program</strong></li>
<li><strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>most useful obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>best game that is obfuscated</strong></li>
<li><strong>most creatively obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>most deceptive C code</strong> (code with deceptive comments and source code)</li>
<li><strong>best X program</strong> (see <a href="#likes">OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES</a>)</li>
<li><strong>best abuse of ISO C or ANSI C standard</strong> (see above about compilers)</li>
<li><strong>best abuse of the C preprocessor</strong></li>
<li><strong>worst/best abuse of the rules</strong> (or some variation)</li>
<li>(anything else so strange that it deserves an award)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not limit ourselves to this list. For example, a few entries are so
good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.</p>
<p>In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to to about
half that number: declaring those remaining to be winners.</p>
<p>Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
make it. The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
less clear cut.</p>
<p>Sometimes a final round submission is good enough to win, but is beat out by a
similar, but slightly better submission. For this reason, it is sometimes
worthwhile to resubmit an improved version of a submission that failed to win in
a previous year, the next year. This assumes, of course, that the submission is
worth improving in the first place!</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Over the years, more than one <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a>
has been known to <strong>bribe</strong> another IOCCC <a href="../judges.html">judge</a> into voting for a
winning entry by offering a bit of high quality chocolate, or
other fun item.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
One <strong>should NOT</strong> attempt to <strong>bribe</strong> an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC
judge</a>, <strong>unless you are an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a></strong>,
because <strong>bribing</strong> an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a> by a non-judge
has been shown to <strong>NOT</strong> be effective when the <strong>person <em>attempting</em>
the <em>bribe</em> is made known</strong> to the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>
(i.e., they are not anonymous) AND/OR the <strong>bribe</strong> is otherwise
associated with a submission to the <a href="../index.html">IOCCC</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
With the previous guideline in mind: <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts
for the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> that are <strong>NOT ASSOCIATED

<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> via the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3HSNTEL8RQ1M0?ref_=wl_share">IOCCC Amazon wishlist</a>.
It has been shown that receiving <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts provides the

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See <a href="../faq.html#support">FAQ: How may I support the IOCCC?</a>.
</p>
<p>More often than not, we select a small submission (usually one line) and a
strange/creative layout submission. We sometimes also select a
submission that abuses the <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in an interesting way,
or that stretches the contest <a href="rules.html">rules</a> that while legal, it
nevertheless goes against the <strong>intent</strong> of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Nevertheless, see <a href="rules.html#rule12">Rule 12</a>.
</p>
<p>In the end, we traditionally pick one submission as ‘<strong>best</strong>’. Sometimes such
a submission simply far exceeds any of the other entries. More often, the
‘<strong>best</strong>’ is picked because it does well in a number of categories.</p>
<p>In years past, we renamed the winning submission from <code>prog.c</code> to a
name related to the author(s)’ names. This is no longer done.
Winning source is called <code>prog.c</code>. A compiled binary is called <code>prog</code>.</p>

It is pointless to ask the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> how many
submissions we receive. See <a href="../faq.html#how_many">How many submissions do the judges receive for a
given IOCCC?</a>.
</p>
<p>Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines from around the
world. Winners have appeared in books (‘<code>The New Hackers Dictionary</code>’,
‘<code>Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries</code>’, ‘<code>Pointers On C</code>’, others) and on t-shirts.
More than one winner has been turned into a tattoo!</p>
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="../authors.html">winners</a> receive international fame and flames! :-)</p>
