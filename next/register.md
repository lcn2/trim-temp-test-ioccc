# How to register for the IOCCC


<div id="step_a">
## Step A: Verify that the contest pending or open
</div>

The contest needs to be either [pending](../status.html#pending) or [open](../status.html#open)
in order to register for the IOCCC.

For details see the "[How the contest status impacts registration](#status_impact)" section below.


<div id="step_b">
## Step B: Enter your email address
</div>

- Visit the [IOCCC28 registration page](https://www.freelists.org/list/ioccc28-reg)
- Enter your email address
- Select ((Subscribe))
- Click the **((Next >>))** button

**NOTE**: For submissions with multiple authors, only one author needs to subscribe.


<div id="step_c">
## Step C: Look for the Subscription consent email from FreeLists
</div>

Look for an automated email message from the FreeLists List Manager (_ecartis@freelists.org_).

The email message will have the subject:

```
Subscription consent for 'ioccc28-reg'
```

**NOTE**: The "Subscription consent" email is usually sent by the FreeLists
List Manager within a minute after clicking the **((Next >>))** button.
If you don't see the "Subscription consent" email, check your spam folder.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APPLE DEVICES**: recently Apple has decided to modify subject lines
from emails that are 'unchecked' so the subject might look instead like:

```
***UNCHECKED*** Subscription consent for 'ioccc28-reg'
```

With phones it can take almost the entire preview so if you're using an Apple
product (like an iPad, iPhone or Mac) make sure to check for this. It appears to
happen on all devices as it is on their end (their MTA), not users. Yes this
even happens when the recipient address is not an Apple address!

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving the "Subscription consent"
email, [Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html), and you have tried
several times, ask the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) for assistance.


<div id="step_d">
## Step D: Open the Subscription consent email message
</div>

This email will contain a URL of the form:
`https://www.freelists.org/v/ioccc28-reg/SOME-RANDOM-STUFF`.

Click on that link.

**NOTE**: If you prefer to **NOT** click links in email, simply copy that
URL from your "Subscription consent email" and paste it into your browser.


<div id="step_e">
## Step E: Confirm your email click
</div>

In your browser, for the link referenced in [Step D](#step_d), click the **((Next >>))** button.


<div id="step_f">
## Step F: Content and Verify
</div>

The FreeLists service that you verify that you:

- Have read, understand, and agree to their "_Terms of Service_"
- Have read, understand, and agree to their "_Privacy Policy_"
- Are the owner or authorized user of the email you registered

Once you have done this by clicking the 3 checkboxes, the **((Next >>))** button.


<div id="step_g">
## Step G: Read the Welcome email
</div>

You should receive an automated Welcome message from the FreeLists List Manager
(_ecartis@freelists.org_) with the subject:

```
Welcome to 'ioccc28-reg'
```

Read the "Welcome" email.

**NOTE**: The "Welcome" email is usually sent by the FreeLists
List Manager within a minute after clicking the **((Next >>))** button.
If you don't see the "Subscription consent" email, check your spam folder.

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving the "Welcome" email,
[Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html), and if you have tried
several times, ask the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) for assistance.


<div id="step_h">
## Step H: Receive your Username and Initial Password
</div>

Assuming that the contest is [open](../status.html#open), one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html)
will send via email, your initial [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org) **Username**
and **Initial password**.  This could take up to a **few days**, so **please be
patient** and **PLEASE make sure you sign up in time!**!

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Unless the contest is [open](../status.html#open), the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) will **NOT** be sending out your
initial [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org) username and initial password.

For example, if contest is [pending](../status.html#pending), you will have to
**WAIT UNTIL THE CONTEST IS [OPEN](../status.html#open)** before sending such
email.

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving your **Username** and
**Initial password**, and the **CONTEST IS [OPEN](../status.html#open)**,
and you checked your spam folder, [Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html) for assistance.


<div id="step_i">
## Step I: Login to the submit server and change your password
</div>

Using the **Username** and **Initial password** from [step H](#step_h), login
to the [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org)  **WITHIN 72 HOURS**
(of when one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) sent that email) to change
your password.

See [How upload your submission to the IOCCC](submit.html) for details
on how to change your **Initial password**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you do not change your **Initial password** within
72 hours of when one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) sent that email,
you will have to **re-register for the IOCCC**.


<div id="step_8">
## Step J: Proceed with step 3
</div>

When the is [open](../status.html#open), proceed with
[Step 3: Obtain and compile the latest mkiocccentry toolkit](../faq.html#step_3).

# How the contest status impacts registration
</div>


### When the IOCCC status is _closed_

While the contest is **[CLOSED](../status.html#closed)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** as there is no contest for which you can register.

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../status.html#pending)
or [open](../status.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _pending_

While the contest is **[PEDING](../status.html#pending)**,
you may **register for contest*, however you will **NOT**
receive your own email message containing your [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org)
**Username and Initial Password until the IOCCC is [open](../status.html#open)**.


### When the IOCCC status is _open_

While the contest is **[OPEN](../status.html#open)**,
you may **register for the contest**.  Once you are registered **AND**
the contest is [open](../status.html#open), you will receive your own email message containing your very own
**Username and Initial Password until the contest is [open](../status.html#open)**.  You will need these
to be able to [upload your submission](submit.html) to the [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org).

See also the
FAQ on "[how to upload your submission](submit.html)"
for more information on the submission process when the IOCCC [reopens](../status.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _judging_

While the contest is **[PENDING](../status.html#pending)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** as the current because the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) are in the process of judging the [submissions](../faq.html#how_many)
they received while the contest was [open](../status.html#open).

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../status.html#pending)
or [open](../status.html#open).
