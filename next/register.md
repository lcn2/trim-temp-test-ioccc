### When the IOCCC status is _closed_

While the contest is **[CLOSED](../status.html#closed)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** as there is no contest for which you can register.

for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../status.html#pending)
or [open](../status.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _pending_

While the contest is **[PEDING](../status.html#pending)**,
you may **register for contest*, however you will **NOT**
receive your own Email message containing your [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org)
**Username and Initial Password until the IOCCC is [open](../status.html#open)**.


### When the IOCCC status is _open_

While the contest is **[OPEN](../status.html#open)**,
you may **register for the contest**.  Once you are registered **AND**
the contest is [open](../status.html#open), you will receive your own Email message containing your very own
**Username and Initial Password until the contest is [open](../status.html#open)**.  You will need these
to be able to [upload your submission](submit.html) to the [IOCCC submit server](https:/submit.ioccc.org).
