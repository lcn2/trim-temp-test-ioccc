**IMPORTANT**: Did you read the **Important disclaimers about scope**
and did you check the current **[IOCCC status](../status.html)**?

* [IOCCC rules](rules.html)
* [IOCCC guidelines](guidelines.html)

You may also wish to review the
[mkiocccentry tool repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry),
especially when the  [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html)
are official, to be sure you are **using an up to date official mkiocccentry tool set**.


# Important disclaimers about scope


### When the IOCCC status is _closed_

When the IOCCC status is _closed_, the [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html)
are **OUT OF DATE**.

They are a **very tentative proposal** for the next IOCCC
that is **VERY LIKELY** to be updated before the next IOCCC.
They are are provided as a **tentative** hint **at what
might be used** for the next IOCCC.

**IMPORTANT**: All **tentative** [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html)
are **subject to change by the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) at _ANY_ time**.
See both the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc) feed as _sometimes_ the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) **mention changes** there.


### When the IOCCC status is _pending_

When the IOCCC status is **_pending_**, the [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html) are
**tentative**.

One might think of them as a **beta** release for the IOCCC
that is about to open.

**IMPORTANT**: All **tentative** [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html)
are subject to change by the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) at any time.
See both the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc) feed as _sometimes_ the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) **mention changes** there.


### When the IOCCC status is _open_

When the IOCCC status is **_open_**, the [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html) are **OFFICIAL**.

Unless some significant problem turns up (such as a need to delay
in when the IOCCC will close, or some major bug is discovered) they
will remain **OFFICIAL** for this IOCCC.

**SUGGESTION**: Watch both the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc) feed for the latest news
about any **changes**.


### When the IOCCC status is _judging_

When the IOCCC status is **_judging_**, the [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html) are
for the current IOCCC **that is _no longer open_ for new submissions**.

See the [IOCCC news](../news.html) as well as the [IOCCC
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc) feed for updates
on the IOCCC judging process as well as for the announcement
of [who won the IOCCC](../years.html).
