# Change your submit server initial password

Using the **Username** and **Initial password** you receive via
email in [step 3](#step_3), you need to login to the [IOCCC submit
server](https:/submit.ioccc.org).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You must change your password **WITHIN 72 HOURS**
from when one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) sent that email.

**NOTE**: The [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
is ready for submissions **ONLY WHEN THE CONTEST IS [open](../status.html#open)**.
See [current status of the IOCCC](../status.html) for details on the contest status.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When the contest is [closed](../status.html#closed), the
[IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
may be offline and unreachable as a web site.

To login and change your password, open [https://submit.ioccc.org](https://submit.ioccc.org)
in your browser.  It should look like this:

<img src="../png/submit-server-login.png"
 alt="submit server login screen"
 width=710 height=562>

The login is the UUID you were provided when you registered for the IOCCC and
the password is the initial password you were provided with. Click "Login".

If this is the first time you have logged in with this UUID, you will
be required to change your password.

Assuming everything is fine, it should look something like:

<img src="../png/submit-server-first-login.png"
 alt="submit server password change required"
 width=710 height=808>

As you can see, you have to change your password. Put in your login (UUID
username), your old (initial) password and a new password. For instance:

<img src="../png/submit-server-change-passwd.png"
 alt="submit server changing password"
 width=710 height=808>

Click "Change Password".

Once this is done, you will be able to log in again with your UUID
username and new password.

When the is [open](../status.html#open), proceed with
[Step 5: Obtain and compile the latest mkiocccentry toolkit](../faq.html#step_5).
